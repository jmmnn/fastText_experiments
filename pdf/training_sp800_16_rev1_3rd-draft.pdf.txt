Abstract 
 

Meeting security responsibilities and providing for the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of 
information in today's highly networked environment can be a difficult task. Each individual that 
owns, uses, relies on, or manages information and information technology (IT) systems must fully 
understand their specific security responsibilities.  This includes ownership of the information and 
the role individuals have in protecting information.  Information that requires protection includes 
information they own, information provided to them as part of their work and information they may 
come into contact with.   
 
This document describes information technology/cybersecurity role-based training for the Federal 
Departments and Agencies and Organizations (Federal Organizations) and contractor support in 
these roles. Its primary focus is to provide a comprehensive, yet flexible, training methodology for 
the development of training courses or modules for personnel who have been identified as having 
significant information technology/cybersecurity responsibilities.  This document is intended to be 
used by Federal information technology/cybersecurity training personnel and their contractors to 
assist in designing role-based training courses or modules for Federal Organizations personnel and 
contractors who have been identified as having significant responsibilities for information 
technology/cybersecurity. This publication should also be read, reviewed, or understood at a fairly 
high level by several audiences including the Organizational Heads through the leadership chain to 
the individual.  Some of the titles include, but not limited to, the IT Managers, Senior Agency 
Information Security Officer (SAISO), Certified Information Systems Security Officer (CISSO), 
Information Systems Security Officer (ISSO), Information Assurance Manager (IAM), and Program 
Manager (PM).

Executive Summary 
 
Some of the most effective current attacks on cyber networks world-wide exploit user behavior. These 
include phishing attacks, social engineering to obtain passwords, and introduction of malware via 
removable media.  These attacks and increased complexities demand greater focus on training to the IT 
staff to avoid misconfigurations, bolster hardening and increase response.  Training users (privileged and 
unprivileged) and those with access to other pertinent information and media is a necessary deterrent to 
these methods.  Therefore, in conjunction with Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) 
requirements, role-based training of those individuals with significant responsibility is required. 
 
All Federal Organizations are required to have a security program implemented.  There are many aspects 
included in the overall program.  NIST guidance, NIST 800-50, “Building an Information Technology 
Security Awareness and Training Program” identifies aspects of an effective training program.   There 
are multiple initiatives and guidance to assist with building an information technology/cybersecurity 
program, such as the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE).    The role-based training 
requirement is a piece of this higher level program.  Chapter 2 of this document provides more detail on 
the difference between education and role-based training, and why role-based training is critical to a 
successful security training program. 
 
Meeting security responsibilities and providing for the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of 
information in today's highly networked environment can be a difficult task. Each individual that owns, 
uses, relies on, or manages information and information systems must fully understand their specific 
security responsibilities.  This includes ownership of the information and the role individuals have in 
protecting information.  Information that requires protection includes: 
 

• Information they own; 
• Information provided to them as part of their work; and 
• Information they may come into contact with. 

 
This document, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-16, 
“Role-Based Model for Federal Information Technology/Cybersecurity Training” describes a process to 
develop information technology/cybersecurity role-based training.  Its primary focus is to provide a 
comprehensive, yet flexible, training methodology for the development of training courses or modules for 
personnel who have been identified as having significant information technology/cybersecurity 
responsibilities within Federal Organizations.  It should be stressed that this is guidance and the Federal 
Organizations are expected to tailor the role-based training to meet the needs of their own organization. 
 
This document is intended to be used by Federal information technology/cybersecurity training personnel 
and their contractors to assist in designing role-based training courses or modules for Federal personnel 
who have been identified as having significant responsibilities for information technology/cybersecurity. 
This publication should also be read, reviewed, or understood at a fairly high level by Heads of Federal 
Organizations down through the leadership chain to the Information Technology (IT) individual.  This 
includes several audiences including IT Managers, Senior Agency Information Security Officer (SAISO), 
Certified Information Systems Security Officer (CISSO), Information Systems Security Officer (ISSO), 
Information Assurance Manager (IAM), and Program Manager (PM).

Chapter 1 - Introduction   
 

The Federal government must protect its information and assets. Federal laws, policies, standards, 
directives, regulations and guidance task individuals within Federal departments and agencies  – from 
heads of Federal Organizations  to end users, and every level in between – with a variety of security 
responsibilities. These responsibilities include: 
 

• Protecting and safeguarding information; 
• Identifying and categorization of systems; 
• Assigning impact levels to the systems and to the information stored in and processed by those 

systems;  
• Selecting and implementing appropriate security controls; 
• Testing the effectiveness of the security controls;  
• Authorizing the use of the systems; 
• Authorizing access to systems; 
• Maintaining an effective information technology/cybersecurity posture by continuous monitoring; 

and 
• Carrying out their specific role based security-related responsibilities. 

 
 

Meeting these security responsibilities and providing for the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of 
information in today's highly networked environment can be a challenging task. Each individual that 
owns, uses, relies on, or manages information and information systems must fully understand their 
specific security responsibilities.  All managers must ensure that all users are provided awareness 
training, and that those identified as having significant responsibilities for information 
technology/cybersecurity are appropriately trained based on the requirements of the Federal 
Organization.  Senior Management/Leadership needs to support the role-based training.  Chapter 2 
provides more clarification on how the role-based training plays a critical role in the overall security 
training program. 
 
Before proceeding further it is important to define key terms that will be used and discussed.  These 
definitions are for use in this document and have been developed to provide clarity to the reader.  
Additional definitions can be found in Appendix E, Glossary. 
 
Awareness - the ability of the user to recognize or avoid behaviors that would compromise 
cybersecurity; practice of good behaviors that will increase cybersecurity; and act wisely and cautiously, 
where judgment is needed, to increase cybersecurity.   
 
Awareness Training – consists of instructor led, on-line courses, exercises or other methods that inform 
users of acceptable use of and risk to the organization’s organizations systems.   
 
Base knowledge - the familiarity, awareness, or understanding of security gained through experience or 
study 
 
Competency – being qualified based on demonstration of an acceptable level of skills 
 
Cybersecurity Essentials - the transitional stage between “Basic Awareness” and “Role-based Training.” 
It provides the foundation for subsequent specialized or role-based training by providing a universal 



 
 
 
 
 

9 
 
 
 
 
 

baseline of key security terms and concepts 
 
Education - knowledge or skill obtained or developed by a learning process 
 
Job Function - action for which a person or thing is particularly fitted or employed 
 
Knowledge Unit – the combination of information needed to perform a function or activity effectively 
and efficiently 
 
Proficiency - the state or quality of being competent 
 
Role - the responsibility and functions that a person is currently performing within their organization    
 
Skills – combination of ability, knowledge, and experience that enables a person to do something well 
 
Training - the action provided to a user in the acquisition of knowledge, skills, and competencies in the 
security arena 
 
Roles are established by the individual Federal Organization and Agencies through position 
descriptions, hierarchy charts, responsibilities, etc.  These Federal Organization defined roles can be 
matched to the generic roles used in the role-based training methodology.  Roles with security related 
responsibilities may not be clearly stated within organizations. Everyone has a responsibility in security 
even if their role does not specifically state security responsibilities.  For example, managers who serve 
as owners of systems and applications have responsibility for the overall information 
technology/cybersecurity of those systems (i.e., security of general support systems, applications, 
networks).   
 
All employees must be exposed to information technology/cybersecurity awareness material.  All users 
of information systems must receive awareness training, as required by FISMA.  This awareness 
training helps to shape user behavior to be more secure.  In today’s environment, the most effective 
attacks on systems and networks are often via the exploitation of user behavior. 
 

This document and NIST SP 800-50, “Building an Information Technology Security Awareness and 
Training Program,” describe the following key approaches of an information technology/cybersecurity 
awareness and training program that “Federal Organizations” (e.g., Federal agency/departments, Agencies 
or organizations) should follow to help ensure that individuals learn the appropriate information 
technology/cybersecurity-related material: 
 

• All employees of an organization must be regularly or continually exposed to information 
technology/cybersecurity awareness.  Security awareness techniques may include posters, 
awareness tools/trinkets, periodic e-mails, warning messages, “tips of the day” upon accessing 
an information system, or information technology/cybersecurity events; 

• All users of information and information systems must attend information 
technology/cybersecurity awareness training (on-line or in-person) each year. This material 
should provide cybersecurity Essentials; and 

• Individuals identified by their organization as having significant responsibility for information 
technology/cybersecurity must receive formal role-based information 
technology/cybersecurity training. 

 
NIST SP 800-50, “Building an Information Technology Security Awareness and Training Program” 
provides guidance for building an effective IT security program and supports requirements specified 



 
 
 
 
 

10 
 
 
 
 
 

in FISMA and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Appendix III. A strong 
IT security program cannot be put in place without significant attention given to training agency IT 
users on security policy, procedures, and techniques, as well as the various management, operational, 
and technical controls necessary and available to secure IT resources. In addition, those in the agency 
who manage the IT infrastructure need to have the necessary skills to carry out their assigned duties 
effectively. Failure to give attention to security training puts an enterprise at great risk because 
security of agency resources is as much a human issue as it is a technology issue.  An 
IT/cybersecurity training program should also strive to cultivate an IT/cybersecurity environment 
where behaviors and responses evolve to the point where they become automatic and consistent 
across the environment.  
 
1.1 Who should understand NIST SP 800-16, “Role-Based Model for 

Federal Information Technology/Cybersecurity Training”? 
 
Chief Information Officers (CIO) and other executives should refer to this document to gain a basic 
understanding, beyond what is mentioned in NIST SP 800-50, “Building an Information Technology 
Security Awareness and Training Program” of their organization’s responsibilities regarding 
IT/cybersecurity role-based training.  An organization’s CIO should understand that NIST SP 800-16, 
“Role-Based Model for Federal Information Technology/Cybersecurity Training,” can be used to develop 
information systems/cybersecurity courses or modules to meet FISMA awareness role-based training 
requirement 
  
The SAISO, IT/cybersecurity program managers and staff, senior managers and auditors should also be 
familiar with the scope of this document and understand the applicability of Cybersecurity Essentials and 
the role-based courses or modules for those who have been identified as having significant responsibilities 
for IT/cybersecurity.  The SAISOs and other IT/cybersecurity practitioners should use this document to 
determine when they give responsibility for material development to training developers/Instructional Design 
Specialists (IDS). 
  
Other personnel will need to work together to meet their responsibilities which include, but not limited to: 
 

• Management:  All levels of management will be responsible for their staff training needs; 
prioritize the use of training resources, identify training gaps and evaluate the training 
effectiveness within the work space; 

• IT/Cybersecurity Specialist:  The IT/Cybersecurity specialist will be responsible for assisting, as 
a Subject Matter Expert (SME), in identifying training courses and training aids to meet the 
requirements of the roles or job functions; identify training gaps and needs within the 
organization’s IT/Cybersecurity program; contributes to determining any customization that is 
needed and developing a compliance baseline for the organization; and 

• Training Professionals:  This group includes human resource planners, training 
coordinators/curriculum developers, course developers/IDS, and, of course the trainers 
responsible for developing, presenting and evaluating the training.  This document will assist the 
training profession in understanding the IT security requirements and knowledge/skills required; 
evaluate the course quality; obtain the appropriate courses and materials; develop or customize 
courses/materials; and tailor their teaching approach to achieve the desired Learning Objectives.

1.2 Legislative and Policy Drivers 
FISMA was signed into law in 2002, fine-tuned long-standing information technology awareness and 
training requirements. FISMA clearly distinguishes between awareness efforts and training. Regarding 
awareness, FISMA states that an agency wide information security program includes “security awareness 
training to inform personnel, including contractors and other users of information systems that support 
the operations and assets of the agency.” Regarding training, FISMA directs agency heads to delegate to 
the CIO the authority to ensure compliance with information security requirements, including “training 
and overseeing personnel with significant responsibilities for information security . . .”  FISMA goes on 
to task agency heads to “ensure that the agency has trained personnel sufficient to assist the agency in 
complying with (FISMA) requirements.” Clearly, FISMA intends organizations to identify those people 
who have significant responsibilities for information security and ensure they are trained to the level 
needed to perform their security-related tasks. 
 

In June 2004, OPM issued a revision to the Federal personnel regulations. The changes build upon 
information technology awareness and training requirements contained in FISMA, and capture key 
concepts from NIST SP 800-50, “Building an Information Technology Security Awareness and Training 
Program” and NIST SP 800-16, “Role-Based Model for Federal Information Technology/Cybersecurity 
Training”. This regulation, 5 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 930, Subpart C, is entitled 
“Information Security Responsibilities for Employees Who Manage or Use Federal Information Systems” 
and requires Federal Organizations to provide training as set forth in NIST guidelines. Key requirements 
from the OPM regulation include: 

• Develop an information technology awareness and training plan; 
 

• Identify employees with significant information technology responsibilities and provide role- 
specific training in accordance with NIST standards and guidelines; 

 

• Expose all users of Federal information systems to information technology awareness materials at 
least annually; 

• Provide training to the following groups: 
 

— Executives; 
— Program and functional managers; 

 

— CIOs, information technology program managers, auditors, and other security-oriented 
personnel (e.g., system and network administrators, and system/application security 
officers); and 

 

— IT function management and operations personnel; 
 

• Provide information technology awareness and training to all new employees before allowing 
them access to systems; 

 

• Provide information technology refresher training for agency employees as frequently as 
determined by the agency, based on the sensitivity of the information that the employees use or 
process; and 

 

• Provide training whenever there is a significant change in the agency information system 
environment or procedures or when an employee enters a new position that requires additional 
role-specific training. 

 

OMB Circular A-130, “Management of Federal Information Resources,” Appendix III, “Security of 
Federal Automated Information Resources,” also emphasizes these mandatory training requirements. 
Specifically, it requires that prior to being granted access to applications and systems, all individuals 



 
 
 
 
 

12 
 
 
 
 
 

must receive specialized training focusing on their information security responsibilities and established 
system rules. 
 
1.3 Relationships with Other NIST Documents 
 
 

NIST SP 800-50, “Building an Information Technology Security Awareness and Training Program,” 
identifies the critical steps in the life cycle of an information security awareness and training program. 
Early in the life cycle of an agency’s awareness and training program an agency-wide Needs 
Assessment should be conducted. The results of the Needs Assessment should serve as the basis of an 
implementation strategy, which should be developed and then approved by the organization’s 
management. This strategic planning document identifies implementation tasks to be performed in 
support of established agency security training goals. 
 
Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 200, “Minimum Security Requirements for Federal 
Information and Information Systems,” introduces awareness and training as one of the seventeen areas 
(called “families” and does not include Program Management) of minimum security requirements 
identified to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Federal information systems and the 
information processed, stored, and transmitted by those systems. 
 

NIST SP 800-53, “Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organzations,” 
provides more detail to the awareness and training area identified in FIPS 200.  This document provides 
levels for each control, dependent upon the system categorization and corresponding baseline.  An information 
system will be classified at a low, moderate or high level.  As the security controls change for each level so will 
the intensity of the training.  Four specific controls in the Awareness and Training (AT) control family 
include:  

 
• AT-1 SECURITY AWARENESS AND TRAINING POLICY AND PROCEDURES 

The organization develops, disseminates, and reviews/updates (organization defined) a formal, 
documented security awareness and training policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, 
responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entitles, and 
compliance; and formal, documented procedures to facilitate the implementation of the security 
awareness and training policy and associated security awareness and training controls.  

 
• AT-2 SECURITY AWARENESS TRAINING 

The organization provides basic security awareness training to information system users 
(including managers, senior executives, and contractors) as part of initial training for new users; 
when required by information system changes; and (organization defined) thereafter. 

 
• AT-3 ROLE-BASED SECURITY TRAINING 

The organization provides role-based security training to information system users before 
authorizing access to the information systems or performing assigned duties; when required by 
information system changes; and (organization defined) thereafter. 

 
• AT-4 SECURITY TRAINING RECORDS 

The organization documents and monitors individual information system security training 
activities including basic security awareness training and specific information system security 
training; and retains individual training records for (organization defined). 



 
 
 
 
 

13 
 
 
 
 
 

 
Additionally, the Contingency Planning (CP) and Incident Response (IR) control families have specific 
controls addressing training: 
 

• CP-3 CONTINGENCY TRAINING 
The organization provides contingency training to information system users consistent with 
assigned roles and responsibilities before authorizing access to the information system or 
performing assigned duties; when required by information system changes; and (organization 
defined) thereafter. 

 
• IR-2 INCIDENT RESPONSE TRAINING 

The organization provides incident response training to information system users consistent with 
assigned roles and responsibilities before authorizing access to the information system or 
performing assigned duties; when required by information system changes; and (organization 
defined) thereafter. 

 
 

NIST SP 800-53A, “Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information Systems and 
Organizations,” provides guidelines for the assessment of the effectiveness of implemented awareness 
and training controls within an organization. Security control assessments are not about checklists, 
simple pass-fail results, or generating paperwork to pass inspections or audits—rather, security controls 
assessments are the principal vehicle used to verify that the implementers and operators of information 
systems are meeting their stated security goals and objectives. This Special Publication is written to 
facilitate security control assessments conducted within an effective risk management framework. The 
assessment results provide organizational officials with:  
 

• Evidence about the effectiveness of security controls in organizational information systems;  
• An indication of the quality of the risk management processes employed within the 

organization; and  
• Information about the strengths and weaknesses of information systems which are supporting 

organizational missions and business functions in a global environment of sophisticated and 
changing threats. 

 
1.4 Scope 
 

This document describes IT/cybersecurity role-based training and its primary focus is to provide a 
comprehensive, yet flexible, training methodology for the development of role-based training courses or 
modules for personnel who have been identified as having significant IT/cybersecurity responsibilities 
within Federal Organizations.  It should be noted that the trainer or training developer are not expected to 
be a SME in all functions but able to provide the appropriate training for a particular role.  
Additionally, each Federal Organization can tailor the training to fit their specific roles. 
 
 
1.5 Audience 
 
Management, from the highest to lowest levels, must understand the necessity of role-based training.  
Planning for the development, implementation and evaluation of role-based training within their 
organization is an essential function of management.  All levels of management should understand how 
roles with security related responsibilities are identified within their organization.  Management should 



 
 
 
 
 

14 
 
 
 
 
 

also be aware of those roles which will require the training as well as those who will develop the training. 
This publication should be read, reviewed, or understood by several key audiences to include the IT 
senior managers and leadership, management, SAISO, CISSO, ISSO, IAM, and PM and/or individuals 
required to understand based on the Federal Organization’s leadership structure.  Target audience 
includes:   

• IT/cybersecurity professionals that have responsibility for implementing the security role-based training 
portions of a Federal Organization’s IT/cybersecurity awareness and training program;   

• Federal IT/cybersecurity training personnel and their contractors  tasked with designing role-based 
training courses or modules for Federal Organization’s personnel who have been identified as 
having significant responsibilities for IT/cybersecurity; and  

• Training developer/IDS tasked with developing and possibly delivering the awareness training 
and role-based training material and courses (or modules), may also use this document as 
guidance.   

 
It is important to note that use of NIST SP 800-16, “Role-Based Model for Federal Information 
Technology/Cybersecurity Training,” by the training developer and instructional designer is critical.  
Those who develop the training requirement and those who develop the training materials must use the 
same training methodology. 
 
1.6 Assumptions 
 
Personnel identified as having significant responsibility for IT/cybersecurity should receive awareness 
training, as well as role-based training to address their additional responsibilities. NIST provides 
guidelines to assist with awareness presentations, awareness training and implementing security 
programs. 
 
Personnel should have a base knowledge of cybersecurity essentials – familiarity, awareness, or 
understanding of security - from previous job experience, training, education (defined as “knowledge or 
skill obtained or developed by a learning process”), and their annual security awareness activity.  With 
this annual security awareness and cybersecurity essential understanding, the following overall 
foundational competencies are assumed for the purpose of this document: 
 

• Mathematics – a basic understanding of mathematics; 
• Organizational Awareness – a basic understanding of their organization and the threats/risks 

associated with it; 
• Quality Assurance – a program for the systematic monitoring and evaluation of the various 

aspects of a project to ensure that standards are being met; 
• Reasoning – solving a problem by considering various possible solutions; 
• Communications – basic writing and communication skills and an understanding of how to 

clearly communicate with peers; 
• Concepts – understands the basic intent of  information assurance concepts;  
• Social Media – a basic understanding of the risks associated with the use of social media; 
• Ethics and ethical testing – conducts all evaluations and actions with approved methods and only 

on those systems allowed; 
• Teamwork - successfully work as a member of a team; 
• Task management – manage time according to a plan, complete tasks in a timely manner; and 



 
 
 
 
 

15 
 
 
 
 
 

• Use of Information Technology tools—basic familiarity. 

Personnel need to understand the basics of risk management, as defined in NIST SP 800-37, “Guide for 
Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems”.  The risk-based approach to 
security control selection and specification considers effectiveness, efficiency, and constraints due to 
applicable laws, directives, Executive Orders, policies, instructions, standards, and/or regulations.  

 

Figure 1.1 Risk Management Framework 

The following activities related to managing organizational risk (also known as the Risk Management 
Framework – see figure 1.1) are paramount to an effective IT/cybersecurity program and can be applied 
to both new and legacy information systems within the context of the system development life cycle and 
the Federal Enterprise Architecture (specific guidance can be found in the NIST SP 800-37, “Guide for 
Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems”).   

• Step 1: Categorize the information system and the information processed, stored, and transmitted 
by that system based on an impact analysis; 

• Step 2: Select an initial set of baseline security controls for the information system based on the 
security categorization; tailoring and supplementing the security control baseline as needed based

on organization assessment of risk and local conditions; 
• Step 3: Implement the security controls and document how the controls are deployed within the 

information system and environment of operation;  
• Step 4: Assess the security controls using appropriate procedures to determine the extent to 

which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired 
outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system; 

• Step 5: Authorize information system operation based upon a determination of the risk to 
organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations and the Nation resulting 
from the operation of the information system and the decision that this risk is acceptable; and 

• Step 6: Monitor and assess selected security controls in the information system on an ongoing 
basis including assessing security control effectiveness, documenting changes to the system or 
environment of operation, conducting security impact analyses of the associated changes, and 
reporting the security state of the system to appropriate organizational officials. 

 
Lastly, this methodology assumes that the role-based training will be tailored to fit the Federal 
Organization’s identified roles and language.

Chapter 2 – Perspectives 
 

Role-Based training is required by FISMA.  FISMA metrics state that 
 

 “successful performance in this area would require the organization to know the 
total inventory of persons needing training and the content of training needed 
based on each person’s role, the actual training provided and the user’s 
performance result (usually test results) ... and have a process to address the 
differences by providing training or removing access rights and responsibilities.”   

 
Furthermore, Role-Based training enhances an organization’s security posture through a trained 
workforce and it increases the individual’s readiness to respond to security incidents. 
 
It is important to understand how the various government directives and guidelines interact with each 
other, and where the authority lies. FISMA is at the apex and represents the congressional mandate for 
Role-Based training.  The FIPS are written as implementers, and these include FIPS 200 “Minimum 
Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems” and FIPS 199 “Standards for 
Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems”.  Along with the FIPS, NIST 
SP 800-37 “Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems”, 
NIST SP 800-53 “Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations”, 
NIST SP 800-18 “Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems,” and NIST SP 
800-50 “Building an Information Technology Security Awareness and Training Program” provide 
additional guidance on how to meet FISMA requirements.   These various documents provide the 
background, authority and additional resources to assist with the implementation of Role-Based training 
 
The National Initiative for Cyber Education (NICE) has published a framework for the cyber workforce, 
including identifying various roles and functions.   The National Cybersecurity Workforce Framework 
should be viewed as a bridge between human resources and the IT/cybersecurity departments.  This 
bridge allows the Federal Government to have a view into the cyber workforce, and provides a 
framework on how to educate the workforce.  This document (NIST SP 800-16, “Role-Based Model for 
Federal Information Technology/Cybersecurity Training “) provides a methodology on how to train the 
personnel within the Federal workforce that have significant IT/cybersecurity responsibilities. 
 
It is important to understand that there is a difference between Education and Training.  The purpose of 
education is to provide learning and understanding of a subject; whereas the purpose of training is to 
ensure the individual can perform (doing) the functions required.  For example, an aeronautical engineer 
is educated on the aerodynamics of an aircraft, and a pilot is trained on how to fly the aircraft.   
 
Training should be focused on providing individuals with the skills necessary to fulfill security 
responsibilities and functions associated with their role; roles that may or may not be IT or IT security 
related.  A role in this document is defined as the job function performed.  A function is the action for 
which a person is specially trained.  This document does not cover every role, but rather provides 
generic roles that can be tailored by the Federal Organization to meet their particular environment. 
 
NIST SP 800-16, “Role-Based Model for Federal Information Technology/Cybersecurity Training” also 
provides guidance on the methodology to develop IT/cybersecurity Role-Based training.  This primary 
focus is to provide a comprehensive, yet flexible, training methodology for the development of Role-



 
 
 
 
 

19 
 
 
 
 
 

Based training courses or modules for personnel who have been identified as having significant 
IT/cybersecurity responsibilities within Federal Organizations.  It should be stressed that the Federal 
Organizations need to identify the roles within their specific organization; tailor the required or needed 
skills and knowledge to those roles, and ensure the training is developed with any specific organizational 
language.  It should be noted that the trainer or training developer is not expected to be a SME in all 
functions but should be able to provide the appropriate training for a particular role.    
 
This document introduces the concept of Cybersecurity Essentials training.  There is a step (or gap) 
between the annual security awareness that is provided to all users, as a general introduction to good 
security practices, and the Role-Based training which is specific to the job functions.  Role-Based 
training is built upon the Cybersecurity essentials.  Cybersecurity essentials training includes computer 
basics and literacy, and could include fundamental computer skills, basic mathematical understanding 
and abilities that cannot be taught, such as teamwork.  The Cybersecurity Essential training is further 
discussed in Chapter 4, the Learning Continuum.   
 
Competencies are acquired when an individual gathers knowledge and hones skills in a certain 
functional area (Knowledge and Skills = Competencies).  Certain roles require certain competencies, 
such as a security engineer requires analytical abilities to detect and identify network problems.  This 
differs from proficiencies, which are acquired through experience and education.  Proficiencies increase 
as the acquired competencies, associated skills and knowledge, are utilized over time. 
 

 
 

Figure 2.0 Cybersecurity Proficiency 
 

It is critical to understand the difference between Security Awareness and Role-Based Training.  
Security Awareness provides individuals with awareness that there are good practices that will increase 
the organization’s security posture, but it is not considered functional or Role-Based Training.  For 
example, security awareness is provided to all employees and contractors from the senior manager to the 



 
 
 
 
 

20 
 
 
 
 
 

administrative assistance.  The awareness agenda may identify where to find security policies, that 
strong passwords are required or that you must wear your identification badge above the waist.  
 
Role-Based training provides role-specific training for an individual based on their functional job and 
responsibilities.  For example, Role-Based training for a network engineer will build upon the 
Cybersecurity Essentials and may include how to specifically set up the roles for the firewalls and the 
consequences if they are not set up properly.  As a second example, Role-Based training for a senior 
manager may include understanding of the implementation of security controls, and the consequences if 
those controls are not implemented correctly. 
 
There are functions and associated roles within some Federal Organizations that are very specific.  Due 
to the sensitivity, uniqueness, and highly specialized nature of these roles, knowledge units and 
supplemental guidance are not provided for these specialty areas.  However, those Federal Organizations 
with these roles can use the current knowledge and skills to develop appropriate role-based training.  
The National Cybersecurity Workforce Framework provides insight into these specialty areas as part of 
the cyber workforce.

Chapter 3 Organizational Responsibilities 
 

While it is important to understand the policies that require Federal Organizations to develop 
IT/cybersecurity awareness training courses and role-based training courses or modules, it is crucial to 
understand who has responsibility for security training as well as those individuals who have 
significant security responsibilities and require the training. Personnel within Federal Organizations must 
understand who within their organization has the responsibility for identifying roles and developing role-based 
training materials.  
 
3.1  Organizational Responsibilities 
 

An individual’s need for IT/cybersecurity training will change as their role changes. Within a particular 
role, over time, an individual’s responsibilities may change as they assume more management, 
acquisition, technical, or oversight responsibility. Some roles will have more management responsibility 
and less technical responsibility. Some roles will have more acquisition-related responsibilities and fewer 
management or technically-oriented responsibilities. Some roles will have more technical 
responsibilities and far less management responsibilities.  Others will have more oversight 
responsibilities. 
 

The training methodology described in this document is flexible to account for the various responsibilities 
found in a role, or across many roles.  The Federal Organization should tailor the training to include all 
their IT or IT security related roles.  
3.2 Organization Head 
Heads of Federal Organizations must ensure that high priority is given to effective role-based training 
for their workforce. This includes implementation of a viable IT/cybersecurity program with a strong 
awareness and training component. Agency heads should: 
 

• Designate a Chief Information Officer; 
• Assign responsibility for IT/cybersecurity; 
• Ensure that an agency-wide IT/cybersecurity program is implemented; 
• Ensure resources and budgets are available to support the IT/cybersecurity program; 
• Measure the effectiveness of the IT/cybersecurity program; and 
• Ensure that the agency has sufficiently trained and will continue to train new personnel to protect 

its information resources. 
 
3.3 Chief Information Officer (CIO) 
 
CIOs are tasked under FISMA to administer training and oversee personnel with significant 
IT/cybersecurity responsibilities. CIOs should work with the SAISO to: 
 

• Establish the overall strategy for the IT/cybersecurity awareness and training program; 
• Ensure that the agency head, senior managers, system and information owners, and others 

understand the concepts and strategy of the IT/cybersecurity awareness and training program;  
• Report on the progress of the program’s implementation; 
• Ensure that the agency’s IT/cybersecurity awareness and training program is funded; 



 
 
 
 
 

22 
 
 
 
 
 

• Ensure the training of agency personnel with significant IT/cybersecurity responsibilities; 
• Ensure that all users of information systems are sufficiently trained in their security 

responsibilities; 
• Ensure all users receive security awareness training; and 
• Ensure that effective tracking and reporting mechanisms are in place for all facets of training.  

 

3.4 Senior Agency Information Security Officer (SAISO)  
 
The SAISO has tactical-level responsibility for the organization’s IT/cybersecurity awareness and 
training program. In this role, the SAISO should: 
 

• Ensure that role-based training material is appropriately developed and delivered in a timely 
manner for the intended audiences; 

• Ensure that role-based training material is effectively deployed to reach the intended audiences; 
• Provide an effective mechanism for feedback on role-based training security material and its 

presentation; 
• Ensure that role-based training material is reviewed periodically and updated when necessary; 

and 
• Assist in establishing a tracking and reporting strategy for training. 

 
3.5 Cybersecurity Training Manager/Chief Learning Officer (CLO) 
 
The Cybersecurity Training Manager/CLO has the responsibility for the specific role-based training 
within the IT fields.  This individual may or may not be a separate responsibility within the Federal 
Organizations: 
 

• Ensure that role-based raining material is appropriately developed and delivered in a timely 
manner for the intended audiences; 

• Ensure that role-based training material is effectively deployed to reach the intended audiences; 
• Provide an effective mechanism for feedback on role-based training security material and its 

presentation; 
• Ensure that role-based training material is reviewed periodically and updated when necessary; 

and 
• Assist in establishing a tracking and reporting strategy for training. 

 
 
3.6 Managers 
Managers at all levels, from the most senior to the most junior managers have responsibility for complying 
with IT/cybersecurity role-based training requirements established for their employees, users, and those 
who have been identified as having significant IT/cybersecurity responsibilities. Managers should: 
 

• Work with the CIO and SAISO to meet shared responsibilities and emphasize the importance of 
IT/cybersecurity role-based training to the workforce; 

• Serve in the role of system owner and/or information owner, where applicable;  
• Consider developing Individual Development Plans (IDPs) for those with significant 



 
 
 
 
 

23 
 
 
 
 
 

IT/cybersecurity responsibilities; 
• Ensure that all users (including contractors) of their systems and applications are appropriately 

trained in how to fulfill their IT/cybersecurity responsibilities prior to allowing them access; 
• Ensure that users (including contractors) understand specific rules of behavior for each system 

and application they use;  
• Work to reduce errors and omissions by users due to lack of specialized role-based training; and 
• Track all training progression and documented record training provided to employees. 

 
3.7 Training Developer/Instructional Design Specialists 
 
Training Developers/IDSs, whether internal to an organization or external, are key players in an 
IT/cybersecurity awareness and training program. An organization usually requires the assistance of 
IDSs for the development of role-based training materials. IDSs should: 
 

• Work with an IT/cybersecurity subject matter expert when developing role-based training material 
and courses to ensure that the proper material is included and is developed to the proper 
knowledge level for the audience; and 

• Understand the role-based training methodology in NIST SP 800-16, “Role-Based Model for 
Federal Information Technology/Cybersecurity Training” since it is used to develop specialized 
courses or modules for those individuals who have been identified as having significant 
responsibilities for IT/cybersecurity. 

 
3.8 Personnel with Significant IT/ Cybersecurity Responsibilities  
 
FISMA requires Federal Organizations to identify and train those personnel with significant 
IT/cybersecurity responsibilities. These personnel - whether executives, IT/cybersecurity program staff 
members, or system/network administrators - are in positions that are responsible for the security of the 
organization’s information and information systems. Because of their positions, they can have the 
greatest positive or negative impact on the confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability of Federal 
Organization information and information systems. These personnel must: 
 

• Attend role-based training identified/approved by their management; 
• Advise their management of additional training that can help them better secure information and 

information systems for which they are responsible;  
• Understand that IT/cybersecurity is an integral part of their job; 
• Understand the organization’s expectations of their position; 
• Understand how to implement and maintain IT/cybersecurity controls; 
• Understand how to mitigate risk to information and information systems;  
• Monitor the security condition of the security program, system, application, or information for 

which they are responsible;  
• Respond appropriately when security breaches are discovered;  
• Apply what is learned during role-based training; and  
• Document and record all training received.  

 
3.9 Users 



 
 
 
 
 

24 
 
 
 
 
 

Users are the single most important group of people who can help reduce unintentional errors and related 
information system vulnerabilities. Users may include employees, contractors, foreign or domestic guest 
researchers, other organization personnel, visitors, guests, and other collaborators or associates requiring 
access to information and/or systems. Users must: 
 

• Understand and comply with Federal Organization and Agency IT/cybersecurity policies and 
procedures; and 

• Be appropriately trained in the rules of behavior for the systems and applications to which they 
have access.  

 
 

  



 
 
 
 
 

25 
 
 
 
 
 

Chapter 4 – Cybersecurity Learning Continuum  
 
To successfully fulfill their roles within an organization, individuals must be given the right tools and 
training.  The right tools and training include a combination of basic security awareness, essential skills, 
cooperative learning or on-the-job training, education, experience and the knowledge, skills and ability 
suited to the role. The Cybersecurity Learning Continuum assists in providing an approach to affording 
all the necessary information for individuals.   
 
The objectives of learning are designed to permit a consistent, government-wide approach to ensure that 
all employees who are involved with IT systems, information technology, and cybersecurity activities - 
regardless of Agency, role, function, job or system – acquire the same, comprehensive understanding and 
training in security.  The value of a consistent training program is the portability of Cybersecurity 
Essentials as employees change jobs and organizations. 
 
Learning is a continuum; it starts with awareness, builds to training, and evolves into education.  The 
Cybersecurity Learning Continuum provides context and the relationship between Security Awareness, 
Cybersecurity Essentials, Training and Education.  The Learning Continuum demonstrates that 
Awareness and Cybersecurity Essentials form the fundamental baseline required for all individuals 
involved with the management, operation, maintenance, development or use of IT systems, information 
technology and cybersecurity.  It also demonstrates that the training and education levels are more 
selective, based on a role and responsibility.   
 
The Cybersecurity Learning Continuum, shown in Figure 4-1, is a progression of learning across the 
spectrum of roles within an organization.  Security awareness training is provided to all users within an 
organization. Cybersecurity Essentials training is provided to all users involved with IT systems. Role-
based training is provided to users with responsibilities relative to IT systems. Knowledge, education 
and/or experience are gained by IT Security Specialists and professionals. The appropriate level of 
cybersecurity awareness, training and education is determined by the role within an organization.  
Individuals obtain skills as they participate in role-based training with their agency.   
  



 
 
 
 
 

26 
 
 
 
 
 

 
The Cybersecurity Learning Continuum is designed to assist in demonstrating the level 
of training and awareness required for roles within an organization. NIST SP 800-16, 
“Role-Based Model for Federal Information Technology/Cybersecurity Training” uses 
generic roles and job titles that may or may not be the same as the roles or job titles 
used by an individual Federal Organization. The roles and titles used within this 
document are a sample of current jobs/roles within various Federal Organizations and 
organizations at the time of publication.  Here is an example to help identify roles, 
responsibilities and training needs:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Pearson is currently a system administrator within a Federal 
Organization.  As an employee of a Federal Organization, Pearson must 
receive the annual security awareness training.  He is also in the 
Information Technology Department, so he receives additional education 
on cybersecurity, known as Cybersecurity Essentials.  In his role as system 
administrator, Pearson has significant IT responsibilities, and therefore, is 
also required to attend role-based training.    
 
Polly, a college intern working as the office administrator for the 
summer, is required to take security awareness training.  However, since 
her responsibilities are not significantly security based, she is not 
required to take any role-based training.  But she may have gained some 
cybersecurity essentials knowledge from her course work or on-the-job 
experiences. 

Figure 4-1: Cybersecurity Learning Continuum 



 
 
 
 
 

27 
 
 
 
 
 

This chapter provides a brief overview of the Cybersecurity Learning Continuum and its application 
within the computer security arena.  The learning continuum is referenced in various NIST Special 
Publications such as NIST SP 800-100, “Information Security Handbook:  A Guide for Managers” and 
NIST SP 800-50, “Building an Information Technology Security Awareness and Training Program”.  A 
model of the Cybersecurity Learning Continuum is shown in Figure 4-1.  Although the curriculum 
provides a generic outline for material, each organization must keep in mind that it needs to relate and be 
tailored to their unique culture and mission requirements.   
 
The curriculum was developed to present topics and concepts in a logical order, based on IT system 
planning and life cycle stages, but may be presented in any order.  However, before it can be expected 
that an individual will be able to understand all aspects of security related to a particular role, some 
exposure to basic security should have been completed.  The material presented is an introduction of the 
concepts and topics only, and these will be further expanded and enhanced at the role-based training level. 
 
The model presented as Figure 4-1 is based on the premise that learning is a continuum. Learning occurs 
over a broad range of levels and topics.  Specifically, learning in this context starts with awareness, builds 
to training, and evolves into education. This model provides the context for understanding and using this 
document, and identifying how role-based training interacts with other types of training.   
 
The Cybersecurity Learning Continuum demonstrates that awareness and training form the baseline that 
is necessary for all individuals involved with the management, development, maintenance, and/or use of 
IT systems. It also demonstrates that role-based training and education are to be provided selectively, 
based on individual responsibilities and needs. Specifically, IT/cybersecurity training is to be provided to 
individuals based on their particular roles and IT/cybersecurity responsibilities, especially if they have 
been identified as having significant IT/cybersecurity responsibilities. IT/cybersecurity-focused education 
is intended for designated IT/cybersecurity professionals in addition to role-based training. 
 
The Cybersecurity Learning Continuum provides the various types of learning.   The type of learning that 
individuals need becomes more comprehensive and detailed at the top of the continuum. Thus, beginning 
at the left, all employees need to be exposed to awareness.  All information system users need awareness 
training. Specialized training is required for individuals whose role in the organization indicates a need 
for special knowledge of IT/cybersecurity threats, vulnerabilities, and safeguards. The “Education” phase 
of the model applies primarily to individuals who have made IT/cybersecurity their profession. 
 
The model illustrates the following concepts: 
 

• “Security Awareness” is explicitly required for all employees.  In today’s environment this 
typically means all individuals within the organization; 

• “Cybersecurity Essentials” is needed for those employees, including contractor employees, who 
are involved in any way with IT systems.  Cybersecurity Essentials is the transitional stage 
between “Basic Awareness” and “Role-Based Training.” It provides the foundation for 
subsequent specialized or role-based training by providing a universal baseline of key security 
terms and concepts; 

• “Role-Based Training” becomes focused on providing the knowledge and skills specific to an 
individual’s roles and responsibilities relative to Federal Organization information systems.  Their 
role within the organization is primary with IT secondary.  Decision responsibilities come from 
the organization role, whereas the technical responsibilities are derived from the relationship with 



 
 
 
 
 

28 
 
 
 
 
 

IT. At this level, training recognizes the differences between competencies among the trainees; 
and 

• “Education” focuses on developing the ability and vision to perform complex multi-disciplinary 
activities and the skills needed to further the IT/cybersecurity profession and to keep pace with 
threats and technology changes.  This can be accomplished with experience, cooperative training 
such as “on the job” training or through certification and advanced education such as 
undergraduate and graduate studies and degrees as accepted by the particular Federal 
Organization. 

 
Learning is a continuum in terms of levels of knowledge, but the acquisition or delivery of that 
knowledge need not proceed sequentially. Given resource constraints, organizations have a responsibility 
to evaluate against the continuum both the scope of their IT/cybersecurity training needs and the 
effectiveness of the training provided. This enables an organization to be able to allocate future training 
resources to derive the greatest value or return on investment. 
 
4.1 Security Awareness 
 
The subject of developing IT/cybersecurity awareness material is discussed in NIST SP 800-50, “Building 
an Information Technology Security Awareness and Training Program”.  The document is a companion 
publication to NIST SP 800-16, “Role-Based Model for Federal Information Technology/Cybersecurity 
Training”.   The two publications are complementary – NIST SP 800-50, “Building an Information 
Technology Security Awareness and Training Program” works at a higher strategic level, discussing how 
to build an IT security awareness and training program, while NIST SP 800-16, “Role-Based Model for 
Federal Information Technology/Cybersecurity Training”  is at a lower tactical level, describing an 
approach to role-based IT cybersecurity training. 
 
The purpose of Security Awareness is to focus attention on and establish recognition of security and 
security issues.  Awareness presentations are intended to allow individuals to recognize IT security 
concerns and respond accordingly. 

 

 
 

Figure 4-2 Security Awareness  
 

Security awareness is a blended solution of activities that promote security, establish accountability, and 
inform the workforce of security news. Awareness seeks to focus an individual’s attention on one issue or 
a set of issues. Awareness activities are intended to allow individuals to recognize IT/cybersecurity 
concerns and respond accordingly.

In awareness activities the learner is a recipient of information. Awareness relies on reaching broad 
audiences with attractive packaging techniques. Training is more formal, having a goal of building 
knowledge and skills to facilitate job performance. 
 
Learning achieved through awareness activity alone tends to be short-term, immediate, and issue-specific. 
For example, if a learning objective is “to facilitate the increased use of effective password protection 
among employees,” an awareness activity might be the use of reminder stickers for computer keyboards 
or global emails to all employees emphasizing the use of effective passwords. 
 
Awareness also strives to build in an organization’s information system user population foundation of 
IT/cybersecurity terms and concepts upon which later role-based training, if required, can be based. 
Awareness informs users of the threats and vulnerabilities that impact their organization and personal 
work environments by explaining the “what” but not the “how” of security, and communicating what is 
and what is not allowed. Security Awareness not only communicates IT/cybersecurity policies and 
procedures that need to be followed, but also provides the foundation for any sanctions and disciplinary 
actions imposed for noncompliance. Security Awareness is used to explain the rules of behavior for using 
an organization’s information systems and information and establishes a level of expectation on the 
acceptable use of the information and information systems. 
 
The fundamental value of Security Awareness programs is that they set the stage for role-based training 
by bringing about a change in attitudes which should begin to change the organizational culture, which 
better secures the Federal organization’s mission through more secure systems. The cultural change 
sought is the realization that IT/cybersecurity is critical because a security failure has potentially adverse 
consequences for everyone.  IT/cybersecurity is everyone’s job. Detailed guidance on IT/cybersecurity 
awareness is outside the scope of NIST SP 800-16, “Role-Based Model for Federal Information 
Technology/Cybersecurity Training” but is covered in more depth in NIST SP 800-50 “Building an 
Information Technology Security Awareness and Training Program”. 
 
In awareness activities, the learner is the recipient of information, whereas the learner in a training 
environment has a more active role. Awareness relies on reaching broad audiences with attractive 
packaging techniques. Training is more formal, having a goal of building knowledge and skills to 
facilitate the job performance. 
 
4.2  Cybersecurity Essentials 
 
The Cybersecurity Essentials level on the Cybersecurity Learning Continuum is the transition between 
Security Awareness and Role-Based training.  This level is the foundation for further specific learning 
related to one’s role(s) with respect to IT systems.  This foundation is required before the individual can 
move forward in their learning.  Training may be tailored to a specific organization’s IT environment, 
security policies, and risks. 
 



 
 
 
 
 

30 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 

Figure 4-3 Cybersecurity Essentials 
 

Cybersecurity Essentials, in addition to knowledge gathered via security awareness, provide a general 
introduction to security.  FISMA requires those individuals with significant IT/cybersecurity 
responsibilities have role-based training.  The transition from security awareness to role-based training 
takes place beyond the security basics and cybersecurity essentials level. 
 
While NIST SP 800-16, “Role-Based Model for Federal Information Technology/Cybersecurity 
Training” concentrates on role-based training, there is an assumption that the individual has security 
basics knowledge.  IT/cybersecurity knowledge grows commensurate with today’s rapidly technology 
changes.  Regardless of its size and growth rate, there are certain basic concepts that form the foundation 
of any effective IT security program and environment.  These terms and concepts must be learned and 
applied as the individual proceeds from security awareness to training and then to education and 
experience.   
 
The Cybersecurity Essentials are necessary to provide an individual with a slightly increased level of 
security material which allows for the development or evolution of a more robust awareness program.  It 
may also provide the foundation for the training program. 
 
Cybersecurity Essentials must not be confused with computer literacy, as the latter refers to an 
individual’s familiarity with a basic set of knowledge that is needed to use and maintain a computer.  
Cybersecurity Essentials refers to an individual’s familiarity with – and ability to apply – a core 
knowledge set which is needed to protect electronic information and systems.  Cybersecurity Essentials is 
not geared to any specific system but rather is the foundation for further learning.  All individuals who 
use computer technology or its output products, regardless of their specific job responsibilities, must 
know these essentials and be able to apply them. 

 
The Cybersecurity Essentials level key terms, essential concepts and principles include an understanding 
of: 
 

• Technical underpinnings of cybersecurity and its taxonomy, terminology and challenges; 
• Common information and computer system security vulnerabilities; 
• Common cyber attack mechanisms, their consequences and motivation for use; 
• Different types of cryptographic algorithms; 
• Intrusion, types of intruders, techniques and motivation; 
• Firewalls and other means of intrusion prevention; 
• Vulnerabilities unique to virtual computing environments; 



 
 
 
 
 

31 
 
 
 
 
 

• Social engineering and its implications to cybersecurity; and 
• Fundamental security design principles and their role in limiting point of vulnerability. 

 
 

4.3  Role-Based Training 
 
Roles are established by the Federal Organizations through positions, position descriptions, hierarchy 
charts, responsibilities, etc.  These show how the work required to achieve a particular objective have 
been identified.  Individuals may assume additional roles based on their individual skills, organization 
policies regarding cross-training and backup, and organizational staffing levels.  Some examples of 
roles include:  network administrator, system administrator, information assurance technician, 
information assurance manager, cybersecurity technician, cybersecurity manager, Computer 
Information Security Officer (CISO), CIO etc.  This is just a sampling of the many roles in the 
IT/cybersecurity arena and may not reflect the roles within a particular Federal Organization.  The roles 
may be tailored to reflect the Federal Organizations environment. 
 

 
 

Figure 4-4 Role-Based Training 
 

Training is more formal, is structured and has a goal of building knowledge and skills to facilitate the job 
performance.   Whereas, the purpose of awareness presentations is to focus attention on security.  
 
The cybersecurity learning continuum model is role-based and defines the IT/cybersecurity learning 
needed as a person assumes different roles within an organization and different responsibilities in relation 
to information systems.   In other words, role-based training teaches a certain skill based on the assigned 
role and identifies the expected knowledge, skills and competencies from the training.  Training strives to 
produce relevant and needed security skills and competencies.  This document uses the model to identify 
the knowledge and skills an individual needs to perform the IT/cybersecurity responsibilities specific to 
each of his or her roles in the organization. 
 
IT/cybersecurity role-based training strives to produce relevant and needed security knowledge and skills 
within the workforce, specifically, in those individuals identified by their organization as having 
significant responsibilities for IT/cybersecurity.  Role-based training supports competency development 
and helps personnel understand and learn how to better perform their specific security role, which 
ultimately better secures the Federal Organization’s mission through more secure and protected 
information and systems. The most important difference between training and security awareness is that 
awareness is intended to make the individual recognize that there is a problem and react.  Training allows 
that individual to react, develop and implement a proper response to the problem. 



 
 
 
 
 

32 
 
 
 
 
 

 
Role-based  training is required for any individual who has influence over an information system, 
application or network; the information; and/or organization mission.  Obvious roles are the system 
administrator or the system developer.   Less obvious roles are the program manager or procurement 
officer, who also needs to understand the security implications of their decision, actions or purchases.  
Regardless, each role has certain skills associated with that role; and that knowledge and associated skills 
must be taught. 
 
Roles are not simply job titles, although a role may be associated with a job title.  Roles may be job titles 
or functions, and are called out differently in each agency.   Whatever the role is called, there are 
associated competencies, knowledge and skills which must be learned by the individual who occupy that 
role.   A role-based training curriculum may not necessarily lead to a formal degree from an institution of 
higher learning; however, a role-based training course may contain much of the same material found in a 
course that a college or university includes in a certificate or degree program. 
 
Competency Levels 
For illustrative purposes in this document three competency levels are described.  These levels may not 
relate to skill or experience levels used by a particular organization.  Figure 4-5 provides a visual of this 
concept. 
 

• Competency Level I skill requirements are basic and are usually obtained during the first few 
years in that role.  Although a person may have been working in the security arena for the last 15 
years, if they move into a new role requiring additional functional skills they would need to 
possess more than Competency level I skills; 

• Competency Level II skill requirements are considered intermediate, and are those skills that have 
obtained and honed during more years in that role; and 

• Competency Level III skill requirements are considered expert, and are those skills that can only 
be obtained after many years in the role. 

 



 
 
 
 
 

33 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 

Figure 4-5, Competency Levels 
 
Over time, individuals acquire different roles relative to their use of information and information systems 
and applications within their organization or as they move within various Federal Organizations. Roles 
can expand or change as an individual progresses through their career, either within one organization, or as 
they make career moves to different organizations. Sometimes they will be users of systems and 
applications; in other instances they may be involved in developing a new system; and in some situations 
they may serve on a source selection board to evaluate vendor proposals for information systems. The 
IT/cybersecurity responsibilities that an individual has will also change over time, and will correlate to the 
role that the individual has, relative to information and information systems and applications. Training 
must be available – whether developed within the organization, borrowed or purchased from another 
organization, or developed by a training company – for people in each role who have been identified as 
having significant IT/cybersecurity responsibilities. 
 
Here is an example of how an individual may have multiple roles during his/her career:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Pearson has been in the IT field his entire career and has had multiple 
roles.  He started his career as a technician on the call desk, and as such, 
would have been trained in that role.  After a few years, he moved into a 
system administrator position, which required more knowledge and skills.  
At year 12 in his career, he changed organizations and became a team 
lead.  This required him not only to receive training in the functional 
perspective of management, but also required him to learn organization 
specific requirements.  He finally ended his career as a Senior Network 
Administrator.  As you can see, Pearson had various roles within his career 
and these roles require role-based training for those various positions. 



 
 
 
 
 

34 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The roles listed and described in NIST SP 800-16, “Role-Based Model for Federal Information 
Technology/Cybersecurity Training”  carry varying degrees of responsibility for IT/cybersecurity, 
depending on what particular work an organization assigns to each role. Therefore, the person serving in 
one role will likely have more or less information/cybersecurity responsibility than will a person serving in 
another role and will need to know more about some aspects of IT/cybersecurity than will a person 
serving in another role. For example, a CIO or SAISO/CISSO will need to know more about Federal laws 
and regulations and Agency policy than will a system administrator. They will need to know more about 
managing an IT/cybersecurity program, while the system administrator will need to know far more about 
implementing and monitoring system-level controls, and usually far less about program management. 
This is why this document focuses first on roles, then on what fundamental perspective the individual 
has and lastly, how much experience the individual has in that particular role.  All of these aspects 
should be considered to be included in a training course or module for each role. 

 
There are roles within some Federal Organizations that are very specific.  These can include roles, such 
as Collection Operations, Cyber Operations Planning, Threat and Exploitation Analysis, All-Source 
Intelligence and Target Operations, as identified within the Cybersecurity Workforce Framework.  Due 
to the sensitivity, uniqueness, and highly specialized nature of these roles, knowledge units and 
supplemental guidance are not provided for these specialty areas.  However, those Federal Organizations 
with these roles can use the current knowledge and skills to develop appropriate role-based training. 
 
The role-based training methodology is described in Chapter 5. 
 
4.4 Education and Experience 
 

The Education level of the Cybersecurity Learning Continuum represents the additional option that both 
current and prospective IT/cybersecurity professionals have to build or enhance their security-oriented 
knowledge and skills.  
 
 
 

 
 

Figure 4-5 Education and/or Experience 



 
 
 
 
 

35 
 
 
 
 
 

 
While many IT/cybersecurity professionals enter the workforce with a formal education foundation, 
“education” as used within the Learning Continuum is meant to address the additional formal 
IT/cybersecurity –focused education that can be obtained to augment training and experience.  
Education can include industry-recognized IT security certification as well as programs that are offered 
by higher education institutions. 
 

To reach the advanced level of IT/cybersecurity professionalization, completion of formal education in 
the field is often required. This professionalization integrates training, education, and experience with an 
assessment mechanism to validate knowledge and skills, resulting in the “certification” of a predefined 
level of competence. The movement toward professionalization within the IT/cybersecurity field can be 
seen among IT/cybersecurity officers, IT/cybersecurity auditors, information technology contractors, and 
system/network administrators, and is evolving. An example of education that leads to 
professionalization is a degree program or certification program.   
 
IT security education/professionalism criteria are outside the scope of this document.   
 
 
4.5 Role-Based Training Differs From Other Types of Training 
 
While the phrase “role-based training” is used extensively to describe the training that should be provided 
to people who have significant responsibility for IT/cybersecurity; role-based training may also be called 
“formal training,” “specialized training,” or “functional training” in some organizations. All of these 
phrases are in contrast to Cybersecurity Essentials, which is the foundation of IT/cybersecurity 
knowledge, upon which the additional role-based training is built.  
 

Topic-based training is training that is developed for a large group of individuals and covers a generic 
area; whereas role-based training allows the recipient of training to learn what he or she needs to know and 
be able to implement the knowledge, based on their current roles. This is perhaps the most important 
distinction between role-based and topic-based training.  Topic based training, for example, is training on 
the Time and Attendance system whereas the learning objectives for every employee is the same.  While 
topic-based training is easier to develop because, for the most part, it can be developed once and for 
diverse audiences, it approaches being a one-size-fits-all solution. Unfortunately, an easy solution like this 
to a complex issue like IT/cybersecurity training can, in itself, be considered as a vulnerability as dangerous 
as a poorly configured operating system or firewall.  Recipients of topic-based training, for the most part, 
must interpret what they see and hear during a training session, determining what it is that they need to 
learn and be able to do and what does not apply to them, based on their role.  

 
Typically, material included in a topic-based training course is meant to be consumed by people who fill a 
number of different roles.  For example, “generalists” – those attendees in many management-oriented 
roles – who need to understand some information about many different topics are likely going to be 
overloaded with details about topics about which they need to know little. Conversely, “specialists” – 
those attendees in many technical roles – who need to be exposed to relatively fewer topics, but must 
understand these topics in far greater depth, are more than likely going to be disappointed when those 
topics are not adequately addressed, therefore, the training will not meet their needs.  As a result, role-
based training - which tailors the training to the role, functional perspective and experience – is required 
within the security arena.   
 



 
 
 
 
 

36 
 
 
 
 
 

Throughout their career, individuals acquire different roles relative to the use of IT systems and 
information within an organization, or as they transition to other organizations.  In these various roles, 
they may be a user, administrator, manager or developer.  They could even have the roles of a source-
selection team for a new IT system, or developing the budget to maintain the IT system and as such, its 
security baseline.  Therefore, the needs for training change as the roles change.  To address this change, 
the role-based training has been segmented into categories of functional perspectives:   
 

• Manage – the individual’s job functions encompass overseeing a program or technical aspect of a 
security program; overseeing the lifecycle of a computer system, network or application; or have 
responsibilities for the training of staff; 

• Design – the individual’s job functions encompass scoping a program or developing procedures, 
process and architectures; or design of a computer system, network or application; 

• Implement – the individual’s functions encompass putting programs, processes, polices into 
place; or operation/maintenance of a computer system, network or application; and 

• Evaluate – the individual’s functions encompass assessing the effectiveness of any of the above 
actions.   

 
These functional perspectives will be further explained in Chapter 5. 
 
Within each of these areas, the trainer should tailor the knowledge and skills to address the individual’s 
role and competency.  That is, are they relatively new to the area – such as becoming a team lead from 
an administrator position?  Or are they very experienced from having been in that role for years? 
 
The tailoring process allows the organization to modify the roles appropriately and align the training 
more closely with the specific training needs for the organization as well as per the individual trainee. 
The tailoring process includes: 
 

• Identifying the needs of the organization/individual trainee (e.g., skills, knowledge and 
competency); 
• Applying scoping considerations to the training modules; 
• Selecting or developing training modules; 
• Supplementing training, if needed; and  
• Providing additional specification information, if needed.  
 

Ultimately, organizations use the tailoring process to achieve cost-effective, risk-based security that 
supports organizational mission/business needs. This includes the training of their employees.  Tailoring 
activities are approved by authorizing officials in coordination with the CLO prior to implementation. 
Organizations have the flexibility to perform the tailoring process at the organization level for all role-
based training.

Chapter 5 – Role-Based Training Methodology 
 

5.1 Role-Based Training  
 

As previously discussed, the role-based training level includes the security-related experience as well as 
the specific area the individual occupies.   Functional perspectives are also helpful to identify and scope 
requirements for each role and enhance the training development and outcomes.  For the purposes role-
based training, the following specific functional perspectives are generically defined as follows: 
 

• Manage:  Functions that encompass overseeing a program or technical aspect of a security 
program at a high level, and ensuring currency with changing risk and threat environments; 
including the management of any program, persons, or operations; 

• Design:  Functions that encompass scoping a program or developing procedures, processes, and 
architectures that guide work execution at the program and/or system level; as well as the secure 
development of systems, networks or applications; 

• Implement:  Functions that encompass putting programs, processes, or policies into action 
within an organization; including operation and maintenance of systems, networks or 
applications; and 

• Evaluate:  Functions that encompass assessing the effectiveness of a program, policy, process, 
or security service in achieving its objectives; including the evaluation of the security state of a 
system, network or application. 

 
In addition to the functional perspectives, the amount of experience the individual possesses needs to be 
considered when providing role-based training.  Experience/proficiency or competency levels are defined 
by each Federal Organization. 
 
All of these areas are used to tailor the training to the specific role. 
 
To further explain the importance of functional perspective, we will revisit “Pearson” as an example to 
show how the area and competency level works.

5.2 Developing and Implementing Role-Based Training 
 
The SAISO, IT/cybersecurity program managers and staff, and auditors should also be familiar with the 
scope of this document, and should understand the applicability of role-based courses or modules for those 
who have been identified as having significant responsibilities for IT/cybersecurity.  The SAISOs and 
other IT/cybersecurity practitioners should use NIST SP 800-16, “Role-Based Model for Federal Information 
Technology/Cybersecurity Training” to determine at which point they hand over responsibility for material 
development to training developers/IDSs. 
 
Both the CIO and SAISO should understand that the role-based training builds upon the Cybersecurity 
Essentials.  Additionally they should understand that the Cybersecurity Essentials is not the same as the 
security awareness training, but rather the bridge between the basic understanding and the specific 
training.   
 
NIST SP 800-16, “Role-Based Model for Federal Information Technology/Cybersecurity Training” 
concentrates on the role-based IT/cybersecurity training.  Personnel will need to work together to meet 
their responsibilities which include, but not limited to: 
 

• Management:  All levels of management will be responsible for their staff training needs; 
prioritize the use of training resources, identify training gaps and evaluate the training 
effectiveness; 

• IT/Cybersecurity Specialist:  The IT/Cybersecurity specialist will be responsible for assisting in 
the identification of one (1) the requirements of the roles or job functions; two (2) training gaps 
and needs within the organization’s IT/Cybersecurity program; three (3) customization that is 
needed and four (4)  a compliance baseline for the organization; and 

• Training Professionals:  This group includes human resource planners, training 
coordinators/curriculum developers, course developers/IDSs, and, of course the trainers 

Pearson has been in the IT field his entire career.  He started his career as a 
technician on the call desk, and as such, would have been trained in this role.  
For this role, the training module would have to cover those requirements in 
“implement” at Competency Level I.  After a few years, he moved into a system 
administrator position, which required more knowledge and skills.  His training 
requirements in this position were functionally aligned with either “implement” 
or “evaluate” and his competency was at Competency Level II since some of the 
experience he acquired as a technician can be applied to his system 
administrator position.  At year 12 in his career, he changed organizations and 
became a team lead.  He was then trained for his functional role to “manage” 
and returned to a Competency Level I since this is a new area for him.  He finally 
ended his career as a Senior Network Administrator - we will assume that 
Pearson had at least 10 years in this role so he would be trained to “implement” 
and is now at Competency Level III.

responsible for developing, presenting and evaluating the training.  NIST SP 800-16, “Role-Based 
Model for Federal Information Technology/Cybersecurity Training” will assist the training 
profession in understanding the IT security knowledge/skills required; evaluate the course 
quality; obtain the appropriate courses and materials; develop or customize courses/materials; and 
tailor their teaching approach to achieve the desired Learning Objectives.   

 
The training methodology described in this chapter focuses on providing the training developer/IDS or 
course developer, with the tools to build a course or module based on the IT/cybersecurity role of the 
intended audience.  Additionally, the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) serves as 
a national resource for government, industry, academia, and the general public in their quest to learn 
about cybersecurity awareness, education, careers, and workforce development opportunities and can 
be used in identifying the organization’s workforce.   
 
 5.2.2 Agency-wide Needs Assessment, Job Task Analysis and Criteria 
 
Before any training should be created, a Federal Organization should identify their training requirements, 
tasks and criteria that need to be met.  Having this fundamental information ensures the training is 
targeted to meet the Federal Organization’s mission and IT/cybersecurity needs, and addresses the variety 
of roles within the Federal Organization.  It is suggested the Federal Organization role-based security 
training be based on the results of a Federal Organization-wide Needs Assessments, which should identify 
any role-based training requirements.  This chapter describes, at a high level, the steps to develop the role-
based training.  
 
5.2.2.1 Agency-wide Needs Assessment 
 
The Agency-wide Needs Assessment will identify the relationship between identified role-based 
training requirements and an organization’s current efforts. The Needs Assessment helps identify these 
additional needs – the gap between what is currently being done and what is required.  This should be 
completed prior to the development of training modules.   
 
An Agency-wide Needs Assessment is helpful in beginning to establish and depict the training 
requirement for an organization.  Conducting the Needs Assessment will assist in identifying any gaps 
in the organization’s current role-based training program, as well as any gaps in the current role-based  
training.  Management must identify the skills required to perform the functions they assigned to 
specific Federal Organization roles.  The role requirements are then analyzed to identify the learning 
required to acquire those skills and how it is expected to be acquired (formal training, On-the-Job 
Training (OJT), etc.).  The focus of NIST SP 800-16, “Role-Based Model for Federal Information 
Technology/Cybersecurity Training” is to develop the role-based training, not to conduct the Needs 
Assessment.  The method of conducting a Needs Assessment is covered in NIST SP, 800-50, “Building 
an Information Technology Security Awareness and Training Program”.  Additionally, NICE can be 
used as a resource for determining the organizations required workforce and the current gaps.    
 
Another important result of the Needs Assessment is the related IT/cybersecurity role-based training 
program requirements. For example, if role-based training material will be presented utilizing 
Computer-Based Training (CBT) technology, a technical assessment should be conducted on the 
organization’s processing platform (e.g., local area network, workstations, video cards, speakers) to 
determine if the existing environment will support the new or expanded training program. 
 



 
 
 
 
 

41 
 
 
 
 
 

 
5.2.2.2 Job Task Analysis and Criteria 
 
Although various organizations may use the same role name to describe or label people who do similar 
work, the actual knowledge and skills needed by incumbents in same-titled positions may vary from 
organization to organization, and even within the same Agency.  A job task analysis that focuses on work 
currently being accomplished by people in the same role, or perhaps more accurately, doing what is 
perceived to be the same work, will highlight what training is needed, or how existing training courses or 
modules should be modified to meet employee needs.   
 
There may be instances in which some people in a role, but not all, are identified as having significant 
IT/cybersecurity responsibilities.  Depending on the criteria that an organization uses to make this 
determination – e.g., impact level of associated information, information system, or application; position 
sensitivity identified in position descriptions; significant IT/cybersecurity responsibilities identified in 
performance plans; specific personnel named in system security plans – some members of a role may be 
selected for training, while others who do not meet the organization’s criteria may not be required to 
attend the training. While these personnel may not be required to attend the role-based training designed 
for those with significant IT/cybersecurity responsibilities, their supervisors will likely insist that they 
receive some training - role-based or topic-based – even the same training as others in the same role. 
 
5.2.2.3 Development Training Overview 
 

After identifying the roles that require training, or any gaps in the current training, the development of 
the training modules can be completed.  The appendices in this document can assist with ensuring that 
the training meets the requirements of the role.   
 
 “Scoping guidance” was first used in NIST SP 800-53, “Security and Privacy Controls for Federal 
Information Systems and Organizations”. Here, in the context of role-based training, “scoping 
guidance” is used to describe the flexibility an organization has to build, or have built, IT/cybersecurity 
courses or modules, using the results of Needs Assessments, job task analyses, and the training 
methodology described in this chapter.  It is recommended that the organization scope the development 
of the training to meet the roles of their particular organization, and use the terminology that is 
understood by their employees. 
 
The identification of a role or roles in need of training would be accomplished by: one (1) a Needs 
Assessment, two (2) an inspector’s review, or three (3) the person or people in the organization tasked 
with identifying those with significant IT/cybersecurity responsibilities.  These processes can also 
identify whether training is to be developed where none exists for a role o r roles, or if existing training 
needs to be updated or modified.  Regardless of how roles are identified for IT/cybersecurity training 
within an organization, supervisors remain the best barometer of individual training needs. Using 
position descriptions, performance plans, and individual development plans, supervisors - with input 
from their staff - can identify training needs.  By coordinating with the organization’s IT/cybersecurity 
training function, supervisors can determine if the needed training is available in-house, or must be 
sought elsewhere. 
 
Various methods to develop training are available to the Training Developer/IDS.  The developer should 
ensure that the complexity of the training is commensurate with the role and the needs of the person or 
people who will undergo the learning effort. Material should be developed based on two important 



 
 
 
 
 

42 
 
 
 
 
 

criteria: one (1) the role, and two (2) knowledge and skills identified for that position.   
 
When developing the training, keep in mind these key steps: 

• Write an explanation of expected core skills to be learned. This is an overview of what class 
participants can expect to learn after progressing through the training materials;  

• Establish learning objectives in accordance with the organizational mission; 
• Dedicate a separate section to each learning objective; 
• Create individual lessons for each of the learning objectives; and 
• Integrate visual elements; use graphics, videos, tables and other visual tools to reinforce 

important concepts.  
 

Training can be developed via various methods, which could include but are certainly not limited to: 
the systematic instructional design model consisting of five phases: (1) Analysis, (2) Design, (3) 
Development, (4) Implementation, and (5) Evaluation (known as ADDIE), Dick and Carey Systems 
Approach, Instructional Development Learning System (IDLS), and Kemp.  In addition to various 
development methodologies, there are various training methodologies.  These could include, but are not 
limited to: computer based training, classroom training, on-line courses and on-the-job training. 
 
Training must be developed and provided if no such training exists for a role, and/or if the organization 
has identified that role as having significant IT/cybersecurity responsibilities.

Types and methods of training need to be determined prior to the development of the training.  Training 
methods can be self-directed, information, formal, etc.   One Agency may choose to use CBT while 
another may use classroom presentations, seminars or some other type of formal training.

5.3 Understanding the Role-Based Training Methodology 
 

5.3.1 Purpose of Appendices 
Overall, Appendices A through D provide the essential elements for developing role based training.  
They provide guidance and information to determine functions, outline role skills and knowledge, 
identifies knowledge units, and provides a method for evaluating training.  Appendices E and F provide 
a glossary of terms and acronyms used in this document, respectively. 
For the purpose of this document, Appendix A and Appendix B use the following terms: 

• Competency - the quality of being adequately or well qualified in a particular area; and 
• Knowledge Unit – the combination of information needed to perform a function or activity 

effectively and efficiently. 
 

5.3.1.1  Appendix A:  Functions 
  

Appendix A is designed to assist in determining which functions and roles should be identified as 
candidates for role-based training.  This appendix should be used by the management and training 
managers as well as the training developers.  Additionally, the outcomes for these functions are outlined.   
 
The format for this Appendix is as follows: 

Training 

Formal 

Other 

Informal 

Self-
directed 



 
 
 
 
 

44 
 
 
 
 
 

 
• Function Area:  Identifies a security function area; 
• Roles Areas:  Identifies various roles that are covered by the function.  These roles are guidelines 

and may exist under different names within a particular Federal Organization; 
• Definition:  Provides a definition of the function; and 
• Learning Objectives(s):  Identifies the various outcomes that the training module should strive 

to meet for each of the functions and their associated roles. 
 
5.3.1.2  Appendix B:  Knowledge and Skill Catalog 
 
This appendix contains each knowledge unit.  Within each knowledge unit are the associated knowledge 
and skills.  The knowledge and skills are specific and the training developer should ensure that these are 
covered in their training modules.  This appendix should be used by the IDS/training developer, training 
manager, and management levels. 
 
 
5.3.1.3  Appendix C:  Roles 
 

Appendix C is designed to assist in determining which competency/knowledge unit and associated 
Knowledge and Skills required by a particular role.  The generic roles and job titles used within this 
Appendix may or may not be the same as the roles or job titles used by and individual Federal 
Organization. The ones used within this Appendix are a sample of current jobs/roles within various Federal 
Organizations and organizations at the time of publication.  Using the competencies and functions, each of 
these samples can be tailored to meet the roles within a specific Federal Organization. 

All roles should have training on the Overall Knowledge and Skills as described within Appendix B, 
Knowledge and Skills Catalog.  These are the fundamental basis of knowledge/skills required for all jobs 
and roles.    The IDS/training developer and training managers would be the individuals that would use this 
appendix. 

The format is as follows: 

• Function Area:  This area corresponds with Appendix A:  Function Area. Appendix A provides a 
general description of the area and the Learning Objectives for those functions.   The roles 
described within this appendix are within a function; 

• Role Area:  This describes the overall role; 
• Roles:  Identifies various roles that are covered by the function.  These roles are guidelines and 

may exist under different names within a particular Agency.  Provided to assist in determining who 
should receive this role-based training; 

• Responsibility:  Defines the activities, tasks and/or responsibilities of that particular role; 
• Knowledge Unit:  Identifies the competencies associated with the role.  The entire listing of the 

knowledge units and their associated knowledge and skills are located in Appendix B:  Knowledge 
and Skills Catalog; and 



 
 
 
 
 

45 
 
 
 
 
 

• Corresponding Knowledge and Skills Table:  This table provides a breakdown of the specific 
knowledge unit, the corresponding knowledge and skills to each competency.  Knowledge areas 
may also be referred to as “functional perspectives.”   Each role has various knowledge units 
associated with it.  There are four (4) differing functional perspectives that correspond with the job 
to allow for further tailoring of role-based training to better match with the job function.  These 
functional perspectives are defined as follows: 

o Manage – those knowledge and skills particular to those employees who are responsible 
for management  (e.g., managers, team leads, project managers) 

o Design – those knowledge and skills particular to those employees who are responsible for 
design activities (e.g., system developers, engineers) 

o Implement – those knowledge and skills particular to those employees who execute 
implementation (e.g., system administrators, network administrators) 

o Evaluate – those knowledge and skills particular to evaluation activities (e.g., testers, 
security analysts) 
 

Flexibility is required for most role-based training.  Tailoring is needed to allow use of the knowledge 
areas in accordance with respective Agency or organizational requirements.  Each Agency should 
determine the most appropriate use of these terms.   
 
5.3.1.4  Appendix D:  Sample Evaluation Forms 

 
The forms that will assist in the evaluation of the training are located within this appendix.  The 
IDS/Training developer and training manager should use these forms. 
 
Although this document includes a number of role-based matrices in the Appendices, this by no means 
suggests that any organization should have to build training courses or modules for each role.  The 
Appendices should be viewed as a catalog of role-specific matrices, some of which will be used to build 
courses or modules.  Organizations should have identified those personnel or roles needing role-based 
training, based on their having significant IT/cybersecurity responsibilities, before using NIST SP 800-
16, “Role-Based Model for Federal Information Technology/Cybersecurity Training”.

Chapter 6 – Worked Example 
 
This chapter provides two worked examples of how to use this methodology.  First is the layout of the 
steps, which is followed by examples. 
 

• The first step in developing role-based training is conducting the Agency-wide Needs 
Assessment.  This action will identify any gaps in the current training program, and/or identify 
those roles which require training.  The guidance for conducting a Needs Assessment is outside 
the scope of this document, but can be found in NIST SP 800-50, “Building an Information 
Technology Security Awareness and Training Program”. 

 
• Once this activity is completed and the role-based training area(s) identified, the second step is 

functions identification.  Appendix A, Functions Appendix, should be seen as a catalog, whereby 
an organization would begin the process to develop training material for a course or module. It is 
important to understand that just because a function or role is listed within the appendices; it does 
not mean that a training course or module must be built for that role.  The Needs Assessment will 
identify those required modules.  Training must be identified, developed and provided if no such 
training exists for a role which the organization has identified as having significant 
IT/cybersecurity responsibilities.   Existing training must be enhanced or a similar course 
identified and provided if evaluation feedback, Needs Assessment and/or job task analysis 
indicates that current training is not meeting the IT/cybersecurity needs of the intended audience.   

 
• After the functions are identified, the third step is to annotate the associated training outcomes 

and learning objectives.  This provides the target for the training developer/IDS.  Using the 
identified function, Appendix C will provide some associated role areas and roles and help shape 
the learning objectives. These provide the training developer/IDS with the ability to tailor to 
match the roles and terminology that the organization utilizes.  Using the appropriate role, the 
corresponding knowledge and skills can be identified (Appendix B).  Additionally, these can be 
further refined by the role’s functional perspective, whether that be the functional perspective of 
manage, design, develop or evaluate. Learning objectives should be observable and measurable 
and ensure they meet the organization mission.    

 
• In the fourth and final step the training developer can tailor the training module to the appropriate 

level of expertise for the audience. 
 
Role-based training can now be developed.  An example of how this would work follows. 
 
The first activity is to conduct the Agency-wide Needs Assessment.  This action will identify those role 
areas that require training.  For this example, we will assume that the organization’s contracting office has 
not been including security requirements in the awarded contracts.  In this example, the Needs 
Assessment determined that an individual has not been trained in any security areas which are identified 
as a training gap. The individual is a Contracts Officer, with 10 years of contracting experience and two 
years ago moved into IT/Cyber contracts. 
 
The second activity is to identity the function and/or role which the training gap is associated.  For this 



 
 
 
 
 

47 
 
 
 
 
 

example, the function area defined in Appendix A is Oversight, Management and Development and the 
role area is Procurement.  The outcomes for this training are also listed in Appendix A and as the training 
is developed, Learning Objectives(s) should be in the forefront, (e.g., Provides contractual, procurement 
and/or acquisition support for purchases).  Additionally, the actual job title can be traced to a 
Role/Function, (e.g., Procurement). 
 
Once the function and role area has been identified, then Appendix B should be reviewed.  The roles 
listed in Appendix C can be tailored to match those roles/job titles of the organization.   At this point, the 
role tasks that the employee executes determine the level to which he/she needs to be trained.  In our 
example, the Contracting Officer has 10 years of experience in contracting, but has only within the last 
two years moved into IT/Cybersecurity contracting.  The employee is well versed and understands 
contracting requirements, but needs to be trained specifically on the security requirements that are 
associated with IT/Cyber contracting.  Therefore, with only two years in IT/Cybersecurity contracting, the 
employee is at a Competency Level I.  This competency level determines the Knowledge Units that will 
be used to develop the training module.   
 
The Knowledge Unit is based on the competencies identified for that role and the knowledge and skills 
required to successfully execute the activities associated with the role.   
 
In addition to the Competency levels, the functional perspective of the role must be considered.  There are 
four (4) functional perspectives:  Manage, Design, Implement and Evaluate.  For this example, the role 
requiring training is the Contracting Officer(s) who are awarding the contracts.  We will assume that the 
contracts have been written and this role is reviewing to ensure that the contracts are ready for award.  
Therefore, we will use those knowledge and skills identified in the “Manage” column in Appendix C 
Module for Roles. 

 
In the Manage column are the following competency, knowledge and skills:  
 

• Knowledge Unit – Procurement 
o Knowledge and Skills: 

 PROC-6;  PROC-7;  PROC-8;  PROC-9;  PROC-11;  PROC-12   
 

• Knowledge Unit – Management 
o Knowledge and Skills: 

 PM-1;  PM-2; PM-3;  PM-4;  PM-8;  PM-10;  PM-12;  PM-14;  PM-16;  PM-
22;   PM-23;  PM-25;  PM-32;  PM-33 
 

• Knowledge Unit – Compliance 
o Knowledge and Skills: 

 COMP-1;  COMP-3;  COMP-4;  COMP-5;  COMP-7     
 

Next, we will go to Appendix B.  This appendix will specifically state what knowledge or skill the role 
contains.  Using the above example, PROC-6 means that the training module should provide the 
employee with knowledge about how to execute secure acquisitions. 
 
The employee is trained specifically to his/her role as well as the corresponding responsibilities of that 
role.  As the training module is developed, these knowledge and skills must be included with the outcome 



 
 
 
 
 

48 
 
 
 
 
 

as defined for the function.  
 
Once the training is complete, then an evaluation should be conducted.  Chapter 7 provides guidance on 
how to successfully evaluate the training.  Appendix D provides samples forms to assist with evaluating 
the training.  Any areas of training that were confusing or did not provide the desired outcome can be 
identified through the evaluation process and should be improved prior to the next training session.  
 
This second example is to show how to do the tailoring.  Using the example above, the audience receiving 
the training has a higher competency.  The trainer may choose to concentrate the training on the skill and 
knowledge areas that are harder to grasp, or have been identified as weak areas by the CIO.  Those skills 
that have been mastered may only be a small part of the training module.  The purpose is to keep the 
audience engaged in the training.

Chapter 7 – Training Evaluation 
 

7.1 Value of Evaluation in a Training Program 
 

Evaluating training effectiveness is a vital step to ensure that the training that is delivered is meaningful. 
Training is meaningful only when it meets the needs of both the student (employee) and the organization 
(employer). If training content is incorrect, outdated, or inappropriate for the audience, the training will 
not meet student or organizational needs. If the delivery vehicle (e.g., classroom, computer-based 
training, and web-based training) is inappropriate, either in relation to the simplicity/complexity of the 
content or to the type of audience, the training will not meet the needs of the student and the 
organization. Spending time and resources on training that does not achieve desired effects can 
reinforce, rather than dispel, the perception of security as an obstacle to productivity. Further, it can 
require the expenditure of far more resources in data or system recovery after a security incident occurs 
than would have been spent in prevention activities such as training. 
 

All meaningless training is expensive, even where the direct cost outlay, or cost-per-student, maybe 
low.  Federal Organizations cannot afford to waste limited resources on ineffective training, 
consequently, evaluation of training effectiveness should become an integral component of an agency’s 
IT/cybersecurity training program. A robust training evaluation effort may be an effective vehicle for 
garnering management support for IT/cybersecurity training programs. 
 

 
7.2 Purpose of Training Evaluation 
 

Meaningfulness of training, or its effectiveness, requires measurement.  Evaluating training 
effectiveness has four distinct but interrelated purposes—to measure: 
 

• The extent to which conditions were right for learning and the learner’s subjective 
satisfaction; 

 

• What a given student has learned from a specific course or training event, (i.e., learning 
objectives and effectiveness); 

 

• A pattern of student behavior or outcomes following a specific course or training event; (i.e., 
teaching effectiveness); and 

 

• The value of the specific class or training event compared to other options in the context of an 
agency’s overall IT/cybersecurity training program; (i.e., program effectiveness). 

 

An evaluation process should produce four types of measurement, each related to one of 
evaluation’s four purposes, as appropriate for three types of users of evaluation data: 

•  Evaluations should assist the employees themselves in assessing their subsequent on-the-job 
Performance; 

•   Evaluations should assist the employees’ supervisors in assessing individual students’ 
subsequent on-the-job performance; 

•   Evaluations should produce trend data to assist trainers in improving both learning and 
teaching; and 

•   Evaluations should produce Return-On-Investment (ROI) statistics to enable responsible 
officials to allocates limited resources in a thoughtful, strategic manner among the spectrum of 



 
 
 
 
 

50 
 
 
 
 
 

security awareness, cybersecurity essentials, role-based security training, and education options 
for optimal results among the workforce as a whole. 

 
7.3 Development of an Evaluation Plan 
 

It is often difficult to get good information for each of the evaluation’s four purposes, as described above, 
and it is impossible to do so without conducting appropriate planning for an evaluation. To evaluate 
student learning, it is first necessary to have written learning objectives, stated in an observable, 
measurable way as Learning Objectives or behavioral objectives. To evaluate teaching, it is necessary to 
plan for the collection of trend data, evaluation, and extrapolation. To evaluate ROI mission-related goals 
must be explicitly identified to which the learning objectives are related. The remainder of this section 
provides guidance in the development of an Evaluation Plan. 
 

7.3.1  Behavioral Objectives 
 

The major components of behavioral objectives are:  
 

• Conditions of Activity – written description of the existing conditions and the learning activity; 
• Activity to be Performed – how the activity will be performed in order to allow the student to 

learn; and 
• Level of Success – how has the student’s performance on the job changed as a result of the 

information learned. 
 
There are several schools of behavioral objectives among educational theorists; however, most agree 
with the three components, described below. 
 

7.3.1.1  Conditions of Activity 
 

This is a written description of existing conditions prior to, and in preparation for, the learning activity.  
Certain conditions must be present to forecast training effectiveness. Does the student need a checklist, 
a set of items to manipulate, or an outline of the information? Does the instructor need audiovisual 
equipment, handouts, or a classroom with furniture set up in a specific format?  Conditions of the 
learning activity, including CBT not just platform training, must be specific and comprehensive.   
7.3.1.2  Activity to be Performed 
 

The evaluation plan must state the activity to be performed in a manner permitting the evaluator to 
actually observe the behavior that the student is to learn—which is observable in class (teacher as 
evaluator) or back on the job (supervisor as evaluator). It is difficult, if not impossible, to measure the 
process of a student’s changing attitude or thinking through a task or problem.  The evaluator, however, 
can measure a written exercise, a skill demonstration, a verbal or written pronouncement, or any 
combination of these outwardly demonstrable activities. He/she cannot take the student’s word for the 
learned skill, or rely on the simple fact that the student was present and exposed to the skill or 
information being taught. Rather, the evaluator must observe the skill being performed or the 
information being applied. With CBT, evaluation measurement can be programmed to occur at the 
instructional block level, with subsequent blocks adjusted based on a student’s response.  Platform 
training differs from CBT since platform training has an instructor in the classroom.  With platform 
training, adjustments can be made in real time by the instructor based on the nature of student questions 
during the course. Adjustments can also be made between courses in a student’s training sequence.  



 
 
 
 
 

51 
 
 
 
 
 

7.3.1.3  Levels of Success 
 

Measures of success should be derived from the individual’s normal work products rather than from 
classroom testing. This directly ties the individual’s performance to its impact on the organization’s 
mission. Written behavioral objectives for a learning activity must include a stated level of success. For 
quantitative skills, must the learner perform successfully every time, or 10 out of 100 times, or 5 out of 
10 times in terms of performance requirements or consequences? Risk management requirements should 
be used to establish the criticality of quantitative skills.  For qualitative skills, what distinguishes 
satisfactory performance from failure, or outstanding performance from satisfactory? Measurements of 
qualitative skills might include the amount of re-work required, customer satisfaction, or peer 
recognition of the employee as a source of IT/cybersecurity information. 
 

The nature and purpose of the training activity, and whether it is at a beginning, intermediate, or 
advanced level, will influence the setting of success measures. If success levels are not documented, an 
individual student’s achievement of the behavioral objectives of the learning activity can not be 
evaluated, nor can the learning activity itself be evaluated within an organization’s overall training 
program. 
 

In addition to the written objectives suggested above, the evaluation plan should show how the 
collected data is to be used to support the cost and effort of the data collection. This can be related to 
types of evaluations, presented next. 
 
 

7.3.2  Types of Evaluations 
 
One type of evaluation is to conduct an exercise that allows training participants to test/validate the 
knowledge of learned behavior following courses.  Through this exercise, the trainer can identify areas 
that may need improvement. 
 
Another type of evaluation is the Kirkpatrick model which was introduced in 1959: 
 

 
 
 
 
For all types of evaluation, a critical step is to ensure the feedback is considered in the continuous training 
process.  Regardless of the type of evaluation that is implemented, the feedback must be looped back into 



 
 
 
 
 

52 
 
 
 
 
 

the training material.  For example, if a student states that Chapter Two (2) was vague, that chapter should 
be updated for clarity prior to the next training session. 
 
7.3.2.1  Student Satisfaction 
 

A common term for this type of evaluation is the ‘Smiley Face’ evaluation. Likert Scale-type forms ask 
the student to check a range of options from poor to excellent (or vice versa) to indicate how he/she felt 
about the class, the computer-based courseware, or whatever the learning activity was. The response 
data is an indicator of how the learning activity is received by the student.  The responses also reveal if 
the conditions for learning were correct.  Some of the questions in this level of evaluation ask about the 
student’s satisfaction with the training facility and instructor (if classroom training), the manner of 
presentation (of the content), and whether or not course objectives were met in relation to the student’s 
expectations. Although this type of evaluation does not provide in-depth data, it does provide rapid 
feedback from the learner’s perspective.  Measurement of training effectiveness depends on an 
understanding of the background and skill level of the training audience.  
 
7.3.2.2  Learning and Teaching Effectiveness 
 

This level of evaluation measures how much information or skill was transmitted from the training 
activity to the learner or student. The evaluation should be in various formats relative to the level of 
training.  For example, at an intermediate or advanced role-based training level, participants should be 
given some sort of performance test, such as a case study to solve. The evaluation format must relate 
back to the behavioral objectives of the learning activity, which, in turn, drives the content being 
presented. The evaluation also provides instant feedback, and it assesses how much the student 
remembered or demonstrated by skill performance by the end of the program, not how he/she felt about 
it. Evaluation can be built into each block of instruction and does not need to wait until the end of a 
course. 
 
An evaluation measures success in transference of information and skills to the student. It enables the 
evaluator to determine if a given student may need to repeat the course, or perhaps attend a different type 
of learning activity presenting the same material in a different format (if available). The evaluator 
should be able to see if a pattern of transference problems emerges, and determine whether or not the 
course itself may need to be reconfigured or perhaps dropped from an organization’s training program. 
 

Behavior objective testing is possibly the most difficult measurement area to address. It is relatively 
easy to test the knowledge level of the attendees after completing a course or block of instruction, but it 
is not easy to determine when that learning took place. An attendee may have had knowledge of the 
subject area before receiving the instruction, so the course may have had little or no impact. Thus, 
information collected solely at the conclusion of a course/instructional block must be examined relative 
to the attendee’s background and education. 
 

To better determine the learning impact of a specific course or instructional block, one approach is to use 
pre/post-testing, in which a test or testing is performed at the outset of the course.  The results are then 
compared to testing conducted at the conclusion of instruction. 
 

Testing of an attendee’s knowledge of a particular subject area by including questions or tasks where there 
is a single right answer or approach, is appropriate for almost all testing situations, especially at the 
beginning and intermediate levels. Questions regarding selection of the best answer among possible 
options should be reserved for those training environments where there is opportunity for analysis 
regarding why a particular answer is better than other answers. 



 
 
 
 
 

53 
 
 
 
 
 

 

7.3.2.3  Student Performance Effectiveness 
 

This evaluation is the first level which asks for more than student input. At this level, the evaluator, 
through a structured questionnaire usually administered 30 to 60 days following the training activity, asks 
the supervisor about the performance of the employee(s) relative to the behavioral objectives of the 
course. This is a before and after job skills comparison. In some cases this information is difficult to 
obtain, especially when employees’ roles and seniority levels permit them considerable autonomy, 
without direct supervision.  When supervisors observe only the final output of employee actions, 
developing a valid questionnaire can present a particular challenge. When accomplished successfully, a 
Level 3 evaluation should begin to show the extent to which the learning activity benefits the organization 
as well as the employee. The learner’s supervisor may determine whether the learner used the knowledge 
obtained in the course to accomplish job tasks, or whether the learner’s performance improved since 
taking the course. 
 

7.3.2.4  Assessing Training Program Effectiveness 
 

This assessment is done by collecting data on whether the participants were satisfied with the 
deliverables of the training program, whether they learned something from the training and if they are 
able to apply those skills at their workplace 
 
Evaluations can be difficult to undertake and hard to quantify. They can involve structured, follow-up 
interviews with students, their supervisors, and colleagues. They can involve comparison of outputs 
produced by a student both before and after training by a subject-matter expert. They can involve some 
form of benchmarking or evaluation of the particular training activity in relation to other options for a 
particular job performance measure.  In all cases, they involve quantifying the value of resulting 
improvement in relation to the cost of training. Evaluations, properly designed, can help senior 
management officials to answer such hypothetical questions as: “Is it more cost-effective to devote 
limited training resources to the education of a single, newly-appointed IT/cybersecurity specialist in this 
organization, or to devote the same resources to Cybersecurity Essentials training of all employees in the 
organization?”; or “Is it a better return on investment to train ‘front-end’ systems designers and 
developers in building security rules commensurate with the sensitivity of the system, or to train ‘back-
end’ users in compliance with currently existing system rules?”

7.4 Importance of Feedback 
 
Critical to the evaluation process is that the feedback obtained be looped back into the training material.  
Thus, there is a continuous process of training, evaluation and then updating the training prior to the next 
presentation.   
 
There are benefits that come with a good evaluation plan.  First, evaluation ensures accountability which 
means that the evaluation ensures that training programs address the training gaps.  Second, it assesses the 
cost and monies spent: evaluation ensures that the training programs are effective in improving the work 
quality, employee behavior, attitude and develop new skills and enhance old skills within a budget.  
Lastly, and, maybe most importantly, evaluations provide feedback to the trainer on the entire training 
process. Since evaluations access individuals at their work level, it is easier to understand and recognize 
the training loopholes and incorporate required changes in the training methodology.

Appendix C:  Roles 
 
This Appendix is designed to assist in determining which competency and associated Knowledge and 
Skills are required by a particular role.  Knowledge is the theoretical or practical understanding of the 
competency.   

Please note that there is no hierarchy within the Knowledge and Skills.   No Knowledge or Skill is of 
greater value than another. The first Knowledge and Skill listed within the knowledge unit has no order 
preference on those Knowledge and Skills listed elsewhere in list. 

Additionally, the generic roles and job titles used within this Appendix may or may not be the same as the 
roles or job titles used by and individual Agency or organization. The ones used within this Appendix are a 
sample of current jobs/roles within various Federal Organizations and organizations at the time of 
publication.  Using the competencies and functions, each of these samples can be tailored to meet the roles 
within a specific Agency. 

Roles for highly specialized areas are not covered.  The roles, and associated knowledge and skills should 
be tailored by the Agency. 

All roles should have training on the Overall Knowledge and Skills as described within Appendix C, 
Competencies, Knowledge and Skills Catalog.  These are the fundamental basis of knowledge/skills 
required for all jobs and roles.     

Abilities are not covered in this document.  Abilities are the specific skills that are obtained while on the 
job using the knowledge and skills that were obtained during the role-based security training.  Therefore, it 
is assumed that abilities cannot be taught, but rather acquired throughout the employee’s career. 

The format is as follows: 

• Function Area:  This area corresponds with Appendix A:  Function Areas. Appendix A provides a 
general description of the area and the Learning Objectives for those functions.   The roles 
described within this appendix are within a function; 

• Role Area:  This describes the overall role; 
• Roles:  A list of various job title /roles is provided to assist in determining who should receive this 

role based training; 
• Responsibility:  Defines the activities  and or responsibilities of that particular role; 
• Knowledge Unit:  Identifies the competencies associated with the role.  The entire listing of the 

knowledge units and their associated knowledge and skills are located in Appendix B:  Knowledge 
and Skills Catalog; and 

• Corresponding Knowledge and Skills Table:  This table provides a breakdown of the specific 
knowledge unit, the corresponding knowledge and skills to each competency.   Each role has 
various knowledge units associated with it.  There are 4 differing functional perspectives that 



 
 
 
 
 

83 
 
 
 
 
 

correspond with the job title to allow for further tailoring of role-based training to better match 
with the job role.  These areas are defined as follows: 

o Manage – those knowledge and skills particular to those employees who are responsible 
for management  (e.g., managers, team leads, project managers) 

o Design – those knowledge and skills particular to those employees who are responsible for 
design activities (e.g., system developers, engineers) 

o Implement – those knowledge and skills particular to those employees who execute 
implementation (e.g., system administrators, network administrators) 

o Evaluate – those knowledge and skills particular to evaluation activities (e.g., testers, 
security analysts) 

  

To assist with the tailoring of the training or to identify courses/modules that may have already been 
developed, there is the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and Studies (NICCS) Portal.  The 
government developed the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and Studies (NICCS) to make 
cybersecurity information and materials more readily-available.  NICCS underscores the four components 
of the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) and serves as a national resource for 
government, industry, academia, and the general public in their quest to learn about cybersecurity 
awareness, education, careers, and workforce development opportunities.  The portal links to various 
courses or modules in cybersecurity that have been previously developed and can be reused.  The URL is:
