Introduction

Organisations today face a global revolution in governance that directly
affects their information management practices. There is an increased need
to focus on the overall value of information protected and delivered—in
terms of enabled services. Due to the high-profile organisational failures of
the past decade, legislatures, statutory authorities and regulators have created
a complex array of new laws and regulations designed to force improvement
in organisational governance, security, controls and transparency. Previous
and new laws on information retention and privacy, coupled with significant
threats of information systems disruptions from hackers, worms, viruses and
terrorists, have resulted in a need for a governance approach to information
management, protecting the organisation’s most critical assets—its
information and reputation. 

Information and the systems that handle it are critical to the operation of
virtually all organisations. Access to reliable information has become an
indispensable component of conducting business; indeed, in a growing
number of organisations, information is the business. 

This increasing dependence on information was apparent more than a decade
ago when Peter Drucker stated:

The diffusion of technology and the commodification of
information transforms the role of information into a resource
equal in importance to the traditionally important resources of
land, labor and capital.1

During the intervening years, value escalation of and dependence on
information have increased exponentially. There is every indication that this
quickening pace will continue unabated into the foreseeable future. Gartner
recently estimated that in less than a decade, organisations will typically deal
with 30 times more information than they do today.2 With the chaos, glaring
vulnerabilities and perpetual crisis-mode activities observed in most
information technology operations, that is not a reassuring notion.

Organisations continue to witness information-related crime and vandalism
becoming the choice of a growing global criminal element. Existing
institutions burdened by countless conflicting jurisdictions and inadequate
resources have not been successful in reducing the amount or impact of these
activities. Therefore, a large portion of the task of protecting critical
information resources falls squarely on the shoulders of executives and
boards of directors.

Guidance for Boards of Directors and Executive Management, 2nd Edition

3 Corporate Governance Task Force, ‘Information Security Governance: Call to Action’, 
USA, 2004

Until recently, the focus of security had been on protecting the IT systems
that process and store the vast majority of information, rather than on the
information itself. However, this approach is too narrow to accomplish the
level of integration, process assurance and overall protection that is now
required.

To achieve effectiveness and sustainability in today’s complex,
interconnected world, information security must be addressed at the highest
levels of the organisation, not regarded as a technical specialty relegated to
the IT department.

An enlightened approach to information security takes the larger view that an
organisation’s information and the knowledge based on it must be adequately
protected regardless how it is handled, processed, transported or stored. It
addresses the universe of risks, benefits and processes involved with all
information resources. The security of information, as with other critical
organisational resources, must be addressed at the total enterprise level.

Information security is not only a technical issue, but a business and
governance challenge that involves adequate risk management, reporting and
accountability. Effective security requires the active involvement of executives
to assess emerging threats and the organisation’s response to them.3

As organisations strive to remain competitive in the global economy, they
respond to constant pressures to cut costs through automation, which often
requires deploying more information systems. Whilst managers become ever
more dependent on these systems, the systems have become vulnerable to a
widening array of risks that can threaten the existence of the enterprise. This
combination is forcing management to face difficult decisions about how to
effectively address information security. This is in addition to scores of new
and existing laws and regulations that demand compliance and higher levels
of accountability.

The Data Governance Council, with a focus on the review and approval
aspects of board responsibilities, recently recommended that boards provide
strategic oversight regarding information security, including:
1. Understanding the criticality of information and information security to

the organisation
2. Reviewing investment in information security for alignment with the

organisation strategy and risk profile
3. Endorsing the development and implementation of a comprehensive

information security programme



IT Governance Institute 9

4. Requiring regular reports from management on the programme’s adequacy
and effectiveness4

In this regard, governing boards and executive management should review:
• The scale and return of the current and future investments in information

resources to ensure that they are optimised
• The potential for technologies to dramatically change organisations and

business practices, thereby creating new opportunities and value whilst
reducing costs

They should also consider the associated ramifications of the:
• Increasing dependence on information and the systems and

communications that deliver the information
• Dependence on entities beyond the direct control of the enterprise
• Increasing demands to share information with partners, suppliers and

customers
• Impact on reputation and enterprise value resulting from information

security failures
• Failure to set the tone at the top with regard to the importance of security

Whilst executive management has the responsibility to consider and respond
to these issues, boards of directors will increasingly be expected to make
information security an intrinsic part of the enterprise’s governance efforts,
aligned with their IT governance focus and integrated with processes they
have in place to govern other critical functions. The purpose of this
publication is to provide boards and senior executives a basis, rationale and
acknowledged approach for protecting vital information assets that support
critical business processes. 

This guide, prepared by one of the world’s leading institutions dedicated to
researching issues and principles of IT governance, is written to address
these concerns. It covers fundamental issues such as:
• What is information security governance?
• Why is it important?
• Who is responsible for it?

It also provides practical, pragmatic advice on:
• What information security governance should deliver
• Questions to ask regarding information security governance
• How information security governance is evolving
• How to measure an organisation’s maturity level relative to information

security governance

Guidance for Boards of Directors and Executive Management, 2nd Edition



1. What Is Information Security Governance?—An Overview

Information security governance is the responsibility of the board of
directors and senior executives. It must be an integral and transparent part of
enterprise governance and be aligned with the IT governance framework.
Whilst senior executives have the responsibility to consider and respond to
the concerns and sensitivities raised by information security, boards of
directors will increasingly be expected to make information security an
intrinsic part of governance, integrated with processes they already have in
place to govern other critical organisational resources.

To exercise effective enterprise and information security governance, boards
and senior executives must have a clear understanding of what to expect
from their enterprise’s information security programme. They need to know
how to direct the implementation of an information security programme,
how to evaluate their own status with regard to an existing security
programme and how to decide the strategy and objectives of an effective
security programme. 

Whilst there are many aspects to information security governance, there are
several matters that can assist in focusing on the question, ‘What is
information security governance?’. These are the: 
• Desired outcomes of information security governance
• Knowledge and protection of information assets
• Benefits of information security governance  
• Process integration

Desired Outcomes 
Information security governance consists of the leadership, organisational
structures and processes that safeguard information. Critical to the success of
these structures and processes is effective communication amongst all parties
based on constructive relationships, a common language and shared
commitment to addressing the issues. The five basic outcomes of
information security governance should include:
1. Strategic alignment of information security with business strategy to

support organisational objectives
2. Risk management by executing appropriate measures to manage and

mitigate risks and reduce potential impacts on information resources to an
acceptable level

3. Resource management by utilising information security knowledge and
infrastructure efficiently and effectively

4. Performance measurement by measuring, monitoring and reporting
information security governance metrics to ensure that organisational
objectives are achieved

5. Value delivery by optimising information security investments in support
of organisational objectives

The National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD), the leading
membership organisation for boards and directors in the US, recognises the
importance of information security. It recommends four essential practices
for boards of directors, as well as several specific practices for each point.
The four practices, which are based on the practicalities of how boards
operate, are:6

• Place information security on the board’s agenda. 
• Identify information security leaders, hold them accountable and ensure

support for them. 
• Ensure the effectiveness of the corporation’s information security policy

through review and approval. 
• Assign information security to a key committee and ensure adequate

support for that committee.  

Knowledge and the Protection of Information Assets 
Data are the raw materials of information. Data by themselves are useless
until they are organised or manipulated in such a way that they provide
information. Information has been defined as data with meaning, relevance
and purpose. Clearly, absent these attributes, there can be little justification
for expending resources to protect it or, for that matter, retain it. Information
is the basis for knowledge. Putting information together in such a way that it
can be used to accomplish something useful is knowledge. Knowledge is
created from information. Knowledge is, in turn, captured, transported and
stored as organised information.  

Information and the knowledge based on it have increasingly become
recognised as information assets, i.e., a business-critical asset, without which
most organisations would simply cease to function. It is a business enabler,
requiring organisations to provide adequate protection for this vital resource.
But to achieve effectiveness and sustainability in today’s complex,
interconnected world, security over information assets must be addressed at
the highest levels of the organisation, not regarded as a technical specialty
relegated to the IT department.

Knowledge is fast
becoming the sole

factor of
productivity,

capital and labor.7

6 National Association of Corporate Directors, ‘Information Security Oversight: Essential Board
Practices’, USA, 2001

7 Op. cit., Drucker



Governing for enterprise security means viewing adequate
security as a non-negotiable requirement of being in business. If
an organisation’s management—including boards of directors,
senior executives and all managers—does not establish and
reinforce the business need for effective enterprise security, the
organisation’s desired state of security will not be articulated,
achieved or sustained. To achieve a sustainable capability,
organisations must make enterprise security the responsibility of
leaders at a governance level, not of other organisational roles
that lack the authority, accountability and resources to act and
enforce compliance.8

Benefits of Information Security Governance
Information security governance generates significant benefits, including: 
• An increase in share value for organisations that practice good governance
• Increased predictability and reduced uncertainty of business operations by

lowering information security-related risks to definable and acceptable
levels

• Protection from the increasing potential for civil or legal liability as a result
of information inaccuracy or the absence of due care

• The structure and framework to optimise allocation of limited security
resources

• Assurance of effective information security policy and policy compliance
• A firm foundation for efficient and effective risk management, process

improvement, and rapid incident response related to securing information
• A level of assurance that critical decisions are not based on faulty

information
• Accountability for safeguarding information during critical business

activities, such as mergers and acquisitions, business process recovery, and
regulatory response 

The benefits add significant value to the organisation by:
• Improving trust in customer relationships
• Protecting the organisation’s reputation
• Decreasing likelihood of violations of privacy 
• Providing greater confidence when interacting with trading partners
• Enabling new and better ways to process electronic transactions
• Reducing operational costs by providing predictable outcomes—mitigating

risk factors that may interrupt the process

14 Information Security Governance
Guidance for Boards of Directors and Executive Management, 2nd Edition

In 2003, McKinsey, in conjunction with Institutional Investors Inc.,
concluded that major international investors were willing to pay a premium
for shares in an enterprise known to be well governed.10 The premium ranged
from 11 to 16 percent in 1996, to 18 to 28 percent in 2000. The demand for
disclosure of the effectiveness of controls and attestation increased with the
advent of financial reporting regulations and statutory requirements. This
study suggests obvious implications for adequate and effective security
governance.

The benefits of good information security are not just a reduction in risk or a
reduction in the impact should something go wrong. Good security can
improve reputation, confidence and trust from others with whom business is
conducted, and can even improve efficiency by avoiding wasted time and
effort recovering from a security incident.11

Process Integration 
A promising concept, driven in large part by the increasing tendency to
segment security into separate but related functions, focuses on the
integration of an organisation’s management assurance processes regarding
security. This can serve to improve overall security and operational
efficiencies. 

These activities are at times fragmented and segmented in silos with different
reporting structures. They tend to use different terminology and generally
reflect different understandings of their processes and outcomes with, at
times, little in common. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to
seamlessly integrate them. Results include overlapping security initiatives,
which waste resources, or major gaps that can lead to serious security
compromises. An illustrative example is a case where two people posing as
repair technicians physically took several electronically well-secured database
servers from a customs office. Another involved a technically secure network
used to process fraudulent orders. In both cases, the lack of integration of
management processes left large gaps, resulting in serious impacts. 

Evaluating management processes from start to finish, along with their
controls, can mitigate the tendency for security gaps to exist amongst various
functions.

2. Why Are Information Security and Information Security 
Governance Important?

A key goal of information security is to reduce adverse impacts on the
organisation to an acceptable level of risk. Information security protects
information assets against the risk of loss, operational discontinuity, misuse,
unauthorised disclosure, inaccessibility and damage. It also protects against
the ever-increasing potential for civil or legal liability that organisations face
as a result of information inaccuracy and loss, or the absence of due care in
its protection.

Information security covers all information processes, physical and
electronic, regardless whether they involve people and technology or
relationships with trading partners, customers and third parties. Information
security addresses information protection, confidentiality, availability and
integrity throughout the life cycle of the information and its use within the
organisation.

Given the dramatic rise of information crimes, including phishing and other
cyberattacks, few today would contend that improved security is not a
requirement. With new worms/malware and the increase in reported losses of
confidential customer information and intellectual property theft, senior
management is left with little choice but to address these issues. Information
security requires a balance between sound management and applied
technology. With the widespread use of networks, individuals and
organisations are concerned with other risks pertaining to privacy of personal
information and the organisation’s need to protect the confidentiality of
information, whilst encouraging electronic business.12

The systems and processes that handle information have become pervasive
throughout enterprises. Organisations may survive the loss of other assets,
including facilities, equipment and people, but few can continue with the
loss of their critical information (i.e., accounting and financial reporting
information and operations and process knowledge and information) or
customer data. The risks, benefits and opportunities these resources present
have made information security governance a critical facet of overall
governance. 

Information security should be an integral part of enterprise governance,
aligned with IT governance and integrated into strategy, concept, design,
implementation and operation. Protecting critical information must constitute
one of the major risks to be considered in management strategies and should
also be recognised as a crucial contributor to success.

Guidance for Boards of Directors and Executive Management, 2nd Edition

Thus, information security governance requires senior management
commitment, a security-aware culture, promotion of good security practices
and compliance with policy. It is easier to buy a solution than to change a
culture, but even the most secure system will not achieve a significant
degree of security if used by ill-informed, untrained, careless or indifferent
personnel.

Information security is a top-down process requiring a comprehensive
security strategy that is explicitly linked to the organisation’s business
processes and strategy. Security must address entire organisational processes,
both physical and technical, from end to end. 

To ensure that all relevant elements of security are addressed in an
organisational security strategy, several security standards have been
developed to provide guidance and ensure comprehensiveness. Some of the
most commonly used standards include Control Objectives for Information
and related Technology (COBIT), ISO 17799, and others such as FIPS
Publication 200 and NIST 800-53 in the US.

A formal security strategy is implemented in part by developing and
deploying comprehensive security policies that reflect the objectives of the
organisation and address each element of the strategy. To provide effective
governance, a set of enterprise standards for each policy must be developed
to define boundaries for acceptable processes and procedures along with
assigned roles and responsibilities. Education, awareness and training must
be provided to all personnel as part of an ongoing process to ensure that
behaviours support secure, reliable operations.

Along with security policies, a comprehensive security programme includes:
• Development/maintenance of security policies
• Assignment of roles, responsibilities, authority and accountability
• Development/maintenance of a security and control framework that

consists of standards, measures, practices and procedures
• Periodic assessments of risks and business impact analyses
• Classification and assignment of ownership of information assets
• Adequate, effective and tested controls for people, processes and

technology
• Integration of security into all organisational processes 
• Processes to monitor security elements 
• Information security incident management
• Effective identity and access management processes for users and suppliers

of information
• Meaningful monitoring and metrics of security performance
• Education of all users, managers and board members regarding information

security requirements



• Annual information security evaluations and performance reports to the
board of directors

• Plan for remedial action to address information security deficiencies
• Training in the operation of security processes
• Development and testing of plans for continuing the business in case of

interruption or disaster 

Some aspects of a security programme may hold more relevance for senior
management than others. For example, countries such as Japan, France,
Canada, India, the US and Australia are focusing on the adequacy and
testing of controls for financial reporting from a regulatory/statutory or legal
perspective. Information security is one of the critical requirements of
controlled financial reporting. Within the European Union (EU), a focus on
the privacy perspective as it relates to security and confidentiality of personal
information may be of equal or greater significance. 

Organisations may also have special security requirements or objectives
resulting from partnerships or customer contractual arrangements. Therefore,
it is critical that management ensure that these considerations are tightly
aligned with enterprise policies and procedures, and adequate resources are
allocated to support the overall enterprise strategy.

A comprehensive security programme implements the protection of
information assets through a layered series of technological and non-
technological safeguards and controls (i.e., safety and environmental security
measures, perimeter and physical security, background checks, access
control security measures, user identifiers, passwords, IT technical measures
and manual and automated procedures). These safeguards and controls are
necessary and should address threats and vulnerabilities in a manner that
reduces potential impacts to a defined, acceptable level. Necessary and key
controls and their objectives are covered comprehensively within COBIT. 

Information Security Governance Defined
Information security governance is a subset of enterprise governance that
provides strategic direction, ensures that objectives are achieved, manages
risks appropriately, uses organisational resources responsibly, and monitors
the success or failure of the enterprise security programme.

Information security deals with all aspects of information (spoken, written,
printed, electronic or any other medium) and information handling (created,
viewed, transported, stored or destroyed). This is contrasted with IT security
that is concerned with security of information within the boundaries of the
network infrastructure technology domain. Typically, confidential
information disclosed in an elevator conversation or sent via regular mail

would be outside the scope of IT security. However, from an information
security perspective, the nature and type of compromise is not as important
as the fact that security has been breached; that is the crucial concern.

To achieve effective information security governance, management must
establish and maintain a framework to guide the development and
maintenance of a comprehensive information security programme.

The information security governance framework generally consists of:
• An information security risk management methodology
• A comprehensive security strategy explicitly linked with business and IT

objectives
• An effective security organisational structure 
• A security strategy that talks about the value of information protected—and

delivered
• Security policies that address each aspect of strategy, control and regulation
• A complete set of security standards for each policy to ensure that

procedures and guidelines comply with policy
• Institutionalised monitoring processes to ensure compliance and provide

feedback on effectiveness and mitigation of risk
• A process to ensure continued evaluation and update of security policies,

standards, procedures and risks

This framework in turn provides the basis for the development of a cost-
effective information security programme that supports the organisation’s
goals and provides an acceptable level of predictability for operations by
limiting the impacts of adverse events. The overall objective of the
programme is to provide assurance that information assets are given a level
of protection commensurate with their value or the risk their compromise
poses to the organisation. 

The framework generates a set of activities that supports fulfilment of this
objective. Figure 1 indicates the necessary people components in developing
a security strategy aligned with business objectives. 

To promote alignment, the business strategy provides one of the inputs into
risk management and information security strategy development. Other
inputs are the business processes, risk assessments, business input analyses
and the information resources critical for their success. Regulatory
requirements must also be considered in developing the security strategy.
Security requirements are the output of the risk management activity and are
input to the planning activity together with the current state of the enterprise
relative to these security requirements. Other inputs to the planning stage are
the available resources and applicable constraints for achieving the desired
state of security.



The strategy provides the basis for an action plan comprised of one or more
security programmes that, as implemented, achieve the security objectives.
The strategy and action plans must contain provisions for monitoring as well
as defined metrics to determine the level of success. This provides feedback
to the chief information security officer (CISO) and steering committee to
allow for mid-course correction and ensure that security initiatives are on
track to meet defined objectives.

Once managers and directors know what information resources need what
level of protection, information security baselines can be developed and
implemented. Information security baselines are the minimum acceptable
security that should be provided to protect information resources. Baselines
vary depending on the sensitivity and criticality of the asset. Baselines can
be expressed as technical, procedural and personnel standards throughout the
enterprise. They are normally developed using a combination of accepted
global standards such as COBIT, ISO 17799 and country-specific guidance
such as FIPS Publication 200, NIST Special Publication 800-53 and
Corporate Information Security Working Group (CISWG), as well as
decisions by the organisation on the acceptable level of risk weighed against
the cost of mitigation. An example of a baseline is COBIT Security Baseline,13

which provides security awareness and guidance for professional users, home
users, managers, executives, senior executives and boards of
directors/trustees.

20 Information Security Governance
Guidance for Boards of Directors and Executive Management, 2nd Edition

Whilst emerging definitions of the scope of information security are adding
concepts such as information usefulness and possession—the latter to cope
with theft, deception and fraud—the networked economy adds the critical
need for trust and accountability in electronic transactions. 

In this context, the security objective is met when:
• Information is available and usable when required, and the systems that

provide it can appropriately resist or recover from attacks (availability)
• Information is observed by or disclosed to only those who have a need to

know (confidentiality)
• Information is protected against unauthorised modification (integrity)
• Business transactions as well as information exchanges between enterprise

locations or with external trading partners can be trusted (authenticity and
non-repudiation)

The relative priority and significance of availability, confidentiality, integrity,
authenticity and non-repudiation vary according to the data within the
information system and the business context in which they are used. For
example, integrity is especially important relative to management
information due to the impact that information has on critical strategy-
related decisions and financial reporting. Confidentiality may be the most
critical today as it relates to personal, financial or medical information, or
the protection of trade secrets and other forms of intellectual property (IP).  



3. Who Should Be Concerned With Information Security Governance?

Boards of Directors/Trustees 
It is a fundamental responsibility of senior management to protect the
interests of the organisation’s stakeholders. This includes understanding risks
to the business to ensure that they are adequately addressed from a
governance perspective. To do so effectively requires managing risks,
including information security risks, by integrating information security
governance in the overall enterprise governance framework of the
organisation.

Information security governance requires strategic direction and impetus. It
requires commitment, resources and assignment of responsibility for
information security management, as well as a means for the board to
determine that its intent has been met. Experience has shown that the
effectiveness of information security governance is dependent on the
involvement of senior management in approving policy, and appropriate
monitoring and metrics coupled with reporting and trend analysis.

Members of the board need to be aware of the organisation’s information
assets and their criticality to ongoing business operations. This can be
accomplished by periodically providing the board with the high-level results
of comprehensive risk assessments and business impact analyses. It may also
be accomplished by business dependency assessments of information
resources. A result of these activities should include board members
validating/ratifying the key assets they want protected and confirming that
protection levels and priorities are appropriate to a recognised standard of
due care.

The tone at the top must be conducive to effective security governance. It is
unreasonable to expect lower-level personnel to abide by security policies if
senior management does not. Visible and periodic board member
endorsement of intrinsic security policies provides the basis for ensuring that
security expectations are met at all levels of the enterprise. Penalties for 
non-compliance must be defined, communicated and enforced from the
board level down.

Executives 
Implementing effective security governance and defining the strategic
security objectives of an organisation are complex, arduous tasks. They
require leadership and ongoing support from executive management to
succeed. Developing an effective information security strategy requires

integration with and co-operation of business unit managers and process
owners. A successful outcome is the alignment of information security
activities in support of organisational objectives. The extent to which this is
achieved will determine the effectiveness of the information security
programme in meeting the desired objective of providing a predictable,
defined level of management assurance for business processes and an
acceptable level of impact from adverse events. 

An example of this is the foundation for the US federal government’s
cybersecurity, which requires assigning clear and unambiguous authority and
responsibility for security, holding officials accountable for fulfilling those
responsibilities, and integrating security requirements into budget and capital
planning processes.15

Steering Committee
Information security affects all aspects of an organisation. To ensure that all
stakeholders affected by security considerations are involved, a steering
committee of executives should be formed. Members of such a committee
may include, amongst others, the chief executive officer (CEO) or designee,
business unit executives, chief financial officer (CFO), chief information
officer (CIO)/IT director, chief security officer (CSO), CISO, human
resources, legal, risk management, audit, operations and public relations.  
A steering committee serves as an effective communication channel for
management’s aims and directions and provides an ongoing basis for
ensuring alignment of the security programme with organisational objectives. 
It is also instrumental in achieving behaviour change toward a culture that
promotes good security practices and policy compliance.

Chief Information Security Officer
All organisations have a CISO whether or not anyone holds that title. It may
be de facto the CIO, CSO, CFO or, in some cases, the CEO, even when there
is an information security office or director in place. The scope and breadth
of information security concerns are such that the authority required and the
responsibility taken inevitably end up with a C-level officer or executive
manager. Legal responsibility, by default, extends up the command structure
and ultimately resides with senior management and the board of directors.
Failure to recognise this and implement appropriate governance structures
can result in senior management being unaware of this responsibility and the
attendant liability. It usually results in a lack of effective alignment of
security activities with organisational objectives. 

15 The US National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace, 2003, www.whitehouse.gov/pcipb



Increasingly, prudent management is elevating the position of information
security officer to a C-level or executive position as organisations begin to
understand their dependence on information and the growing threats to it.
Ensuring that the position exists, and assigning it the responsibility, authority
and required resources, demonstrates management’s and board of directors’
awareness of and commitment to sound information security governance.

4. What Should the Board of Directors/Trustees and 
Senior Executives Be Doing?

Boards and management have several fundamental responsibilities to ensure
that information security governance is in force. Amongst the issues they
should focus on are:
Understand Why Information Security Needs to Be Governed
• Risks and threats are real and could have significant impact on the

enterprise.
• Reputational damage can be considerable.
• Effective information security requires co-ordinated and integrated action

from the top down.
• IT investments can be substantial and easily misdirected.
• Cultural and organisational factors are equally important.
• Rules and priorities need to be established and enforced.
• Trust needs to be demonstrated toward trading partners whilst exchanging

electronic transactions.
• Trust in reliability of system security needs to be demonstrated to all

stakeholders.
• Security incidents are likely to be exposed to the public.

Take Board-level Action
• Become informed about information security.
• Set direction, i.e., drive policy and strategy and define a global risk profile.
• Provide resources to information security efforts.
• Assign responsibilities to management.
• Set priorities.
• Support change.
• Define cultural values related to risk awareness.
• Obtain assurance from internal or external auditors.
• Insist that management makes security investments and security

improvements measurable, and monitors and reports on programme
effectiveness.

Take Senior Management-level Action
• Provide oversight for the development of a security and control framework

that consists of standards, measures, practices and procedures, after a
policy has been approved by the governing body of the organisation and
related roles and responsibilities assigned. (Design)16

• Set direction for the creation of a security policy, with business input.
(Policy Development)

• Ensure that individual roles, responsibilities and authority are clearly
communicated and understood by all. (Roles and Responsibilities)

16 The key words highlighted in this subsection refer to the International Federation of
Accountants’ guideline, Managing Security of Information, USA, 1998.



• Require that threats and vulnerabilities be identified, analysed and
monitored, and industry practices used for due care.

• Require the set-up of a security infrastructure.
• Set direction to ensure that resources are available to allow for prioritisation

of possible controls and countermeasures implement accordingly on a
timely basis, and maintained effectively. (Implementation)

• Establish monitoring measures to detect and ensure correction of security
breaches, so all actual and suspected breaches are promptly identified,
investigated and acted upon, and to ensure ongoing compliance with policy,
standards and minimum acceptable security practices. (Monitoring)

• Require that periodic reviews and tests be conducted.
• Institute processes that will help implement intrusion detection and incident

response.
• Require monitoring and metrics to ensure that information is protected,

correct skills are on hand to operate information systems securely and
security incidents are responded to on a timely basis. Education in security
measures and practices is of critical importance for the success of an
organisation’s security programme. (Awareness, Training and Education)

• Ensure that security is considered an integral part of the systems
development life cycle process and is explicitly addressed during each
phase of the process.

Illustrative Matrix of Outcomes and Directives
The relationships amongst the outcomes of effective information security
governance and management directives are shown in figure 2. These
directives are not meant to be comprehensive but they do illustrate some
primary tasks and levels for which the board and executive management are
responsible.

5. What Are Some Thought-provoking Questions to Ask?

Chapter 8 provides a structured set of questions and practices but those
responsible for information security governance may need some initial
thought-provoking and awareness-raising questions to uncover information
security issues and get an initial feel for what is being done about these
issues.

Questions to Uncover Information Security Issues
• Does the head of security/CISO routinely meet or brief business

management?
• When was the last time top management got involved in security-related

decisions? How often does top management get involved in progressing
security solutions?

• Does management know who is responsible for security? Does the
responsible individual know? Does everyone else know?

• Would people recognise a security incident when they saw one? Would they
ignore it? Would they know what to do about it?

• Does anyone know how many computers the company owns? Would
management know if some went missing?

• Are damage assessment and disaster recovery plans in place?
• Has management identified all information (customer data, strategic plans,

financial data, research results, etc.) that would violate policy, legal or
regulatory requirements or cause embarrassment or competitive
disadvantage if it were leaked?

• Did the company suffer from the latest virus or malware attack? How many
attacks were successful during the past 12-month period?

• Have there been intrusions? How often and with what impact?
• Does anyone know how many people are using the organisation’s systems?

Does anyone care whether or not they are allowed access, or what they are
doing?

• Is security considered an afterthought or a prerequisite?

Questions to Find Out How Management Addresses Information 
Security Issues
• Is the enterprise clear on its position relative to IT and security risks? Does

it tend toward risk-avoidance or risk-taking?
• How much is being spent on information security? On what? How were the

expenditures justified? What projects were undertaken to improve security
during the past 12-month period?

• What percentage of staff had security training last year? What percentage
of the management team received training?

• How does management decide who has access to the organisation’s
information and systems? How often are these decisions revisited?

• How does the organisation detect security incidents? How are they
escalated and what does management do about them?

IT Governance Institute 27

Do not treat
security as an
afterthought.

Address it at every
phase of the
development

life cycle.



• Is management prepared to recover from a major security incident?
• Is there a security programme in place that covers all of the above

questions? Is there clear accountability about who carries it out?
• Does IT staff understand computer forensics/chain of evidence custody

considerations?

Questions to Self-assess Information 
Security Governance Practices
• Is management confident that security is being adequately addressed in the

enterprise?
• Is management aware of the latest information security issues and best

practices?
• Does the organisation participate in an incident, threat, vulnerability

notification and sharing service?
• What is industry best practice and how does the enterprise compare?
• Does management regularly articulate and communicate the enterprise

requirement for information security?
• Does management have a view on how much the enterprise should invest

in information security improvements?
• Are information security issues considered when developing business and

IT strategy?
• Does management obtain regular progress reports on the state of security

and security improvement projects?
• Has management set up an independent audit or review of information

security? Does management track its own progress on recommendations?

6. What Should Information Security Governance Deliver? 

Key goals or objectives help provide information about the target of
achievement for a process or service—they can be used effectively to
determine whether organisational objectives are being met. Information
security governance, when properly implemented, should provide five basic
outcomes, as described in chapter 1. Some illustrative goals selected from
COBIT are presented as follows.

Strategic Alignment
It is often difficult to achieve the goal of strategic alignment of information
security in support of organisational objectives. Consider the following goals: 
• Ensure transparency and understanding of IT security costs, benefits,

strategy, policies and service levels.
• Develop a common and comprehensive set of IT security policies.
• Communicate the IT strategy, policies and control framework.
• Enforce IT security policies.
• Define security incidents in business impact terms.
• Establish clarity on the business impact of risks to IT objectives 

and resources.
• Establish IT continuity plan that supports business continuity plans.

Risk Management
To manage and mitigate risks and reduce potential impacts on information
assets to an acceptable level, consider the following goals: 
• Account for and protect all IT assets.
• Establish and reduce the likelihood and impact of IT security risks.
• Perform regular risk assessments with senior managers and key staff.
• Permit access to critical and sensitive data only to authorised users.
• Ensure critical and confidential information is withheld from those who

should not have access to it.
• Identify, monitor and report security vulnerabilities and incidents.
• Develop IT continuity plans that can be executed and are tested and

maintained.

A key goal of information security is to reduce adverse impacts on the
organisation to an acceptable level of risk. Therefore, a key metric is the
adverse impacts of information security incidents experienced by the
organisation. An effective security programme will show a trend of impact
reduction. Quantitative measures can include trend analysis of impacts 
over time.

Resource Management
Information security knowledge and infrastructure should be used efficiently
and effectively. Consider the following goals:
• Maintain the integrity of information and processing infrastructure.
• Account for and protect all IT assets.
• Ensure that IT services and infrastructure can resist and recover from

failures due to error, deliberate attack or disaster.
• Ensure proper use and performance of the applications and 

technology solutions.

Performance Measurement
Measuring, monitoring and reporting on information security processes
ensures that organisational objectives are achieved. Consider these example
metrics:
• Number of incidents damaging reputation with the public
• Number of systems where security requirements are not met
• Time to grant, change and remove access privileges
• Number and type of suspected and actual access violations
• Number and type of malicious code prevented
• Number and type of security incidents
• Number and type of obsolete accounts
• Number of unauthorised IP addresses, ports and traffic types denied
• Number of access rights authorised, revoked, reset or changed

Value Delivery
Security investments should be optimised to support organisational
objectives. Security activities consume resources. Optimal investment levels
occur when strategic goals for security are achieved and an acceptable risk
posture is attained by the organisation at the lowest possible cost. The
following goals should be considered: 
• Ensure automated business transactions and information exchanges 

can be trusted.
• Make sure that IT services are available as required.
• Minimise the probability of IT service interruption.
• Minimise the impact of security vulnerabilities and incidents.
• Ensure minimum business impact in the event of an IT service disruption

or change.
• Establish cost-effective action plans for critical IT risks.

Guidance for Boards of Directors and Executive Management, 2nd Edition



As mentioned earlier in this publication, process integration is an area of
increased interest related to information security governance. This is driven
in large part by an organisation’s need to rapidly respond to change and
focuses on an organisation’s tendency to segment security-related activities;
thus, there is a need to ensure proper management process assurance over
these activities.

This approach to information security governance includes an effort to
ensure that processes and activities operate as intended from end to end,
minimising hidden risks. Its succcessful implementation is evidenced by
such conditions as:
• No gaps exist in information asset protection.
• Unnecessary security overlaps are eliminated. 
• Assurance activities are seamlessly integrated.
• Roles and responsibilities are well defined.
• Assurance providers understand their relationship to other assurance

functions and regularly liaise with each other.

IT Governance Institute 31



7. How Is Information Security Governance Evolving?

The requirement to improve information security governance will continue
into the foreseeable future. Whilst spending on security has grown in
response to increasing risk, the failure of security to deal with identity theft,
fraud, wholesale loss of customer personal information and a host of other
criminal and destructive uses of information systems continues unabated.
Numerous studies universally support the conclusions presented in this
publication that information security must be addressed as a governance-
level concern. 

The traditional focus on technical solutions must give way to the
understanding that security is fundamentally a management problem to be
addressed at the highest levels. As organisational assets continue to become
more intangible, the requirements of due care in the protection of
information assets will require greater attention and resources. Additionally,
effective information security governance is becoming a necessity to
adequately address the numerous legal and regulatory/statutory requirements.
Organisations that fail to address these issues will find themselves at a
competitive disadvantage and fall victim to ever more technologically
sophisticated criminals. They will find share value increasingly tied to
governance (good and bad) as the market becomes more knowledgeable of
its relevance.

Momentum is growing globally to address issues of privacy and cybercrime,
with stringent regulations regarding operational risk management, full
financial disclosure and privacy protection. A number of jurisdictions are in
the process of creating legislation that will mandate better security
governance practices.17 Organisations can expect oversight to continue to
tighten until the international security situation begins to improve and
failures of security and privacy become less costly to global economies,
organisations and individuals. 

Organisations must consider that failing to provide adequate protection of
critical information assets is becoming more visible and less acceptable.
Liability will ultimately find its way to the boardroom. Senior management
must understand that the absence of adequate security constitutes deferred
risk, which the costs to remedy represent a growing unfunded liability and
exposure.

Management should also consider that the risks of large negligence awards
and the direct financial consequences may be overshadowed by public
exposure of poor governance and substandard practices. These, in turn, have
the potential to lead to reputational losses likely to be reflected in reduced
share value.

Evidence provided by Aberdeen Group’s research19 indicates that losses due
to ineffective security can be reduced by up to 90 percent by implementing
known, commonly used security practices. This alone should be sufficient to
motivate action by responsible management.

Organisations are evolving in their thoughts about information security.
Much more focus is being placed on the value it can deliver to the
organisation, and how it can contribute to enhanced and sustained
stakeholder value. Additionally, given ever-expanding globalisation, privacy
compliance issues, legal and regulatory requirements, and the risk of
potential adverse actions against organisations deemed to be careless or
negligent, it is increasingly prudent for boards and executive management to
address effective information security as a governance concern.

8. What Can Be Done to Successfully Implement Information 
Security Governance?

The following illustrative questions provide boards of directors and senior
executives  a sound way to begin determining the extent to which effective
information security governance is (or is not) in place. These are the
questions those responsible for governance should ask.

Questions for Directors
• Does the board understand the organisation’s dependence on information?
• Does the organisation recognise the value and importance of information

security and set the appropriate tone at the top to foster a security-
conscious environment?

• Does the organisation have a security strategy? If so, is it closely aligned
with the overall business strategy?

• Does the board understand the organisation’s potential liabilities in the
event of regulatory non-compliance? Does it understand the potential
liability in the event sensitive information is compromised?

• Has the organisation suffered a major security incident? Has the cost of the
incident to the organisation been determined?

• Does information security appear as a board agenda item, and is there a
schedule for reporting the status of the information security programme to 
the board?

• Has management issued a policy statement on information security? If it
has, is the policy statement subject to review, update and approval? 

• Can the entity continue to operate if critical information is unavailable,
compromised or lost? What would be the consequences of a security
incident in terms of lost revenues, lost customers and investor confidence?
What would be the consequences if the infrastructure became inoperable?

• Are the information assets subject to laws and regulations? What has the
board instituted to ensure compliance?

• Does the audit committee clearly understand its role in information security
and how it will set direction with management and auditors?

• Is there a CISO or officer specifically charged with managing information
security in the organisation? 

• Are there appropriate training and awareness programmes to ensure that
personnel are aware of their security responsibilities?

Questions for Management
• How is the board kept informed of information security issues? When was

the last briefing made to the board on security risks and status of security
improvements?

• Has someone been appointed to be responsible for developing,
implementing and managing the information security programme, and is
he/she held accountable?

34 Information Security Governance
Guidance for Boards of Directors and Executive Management, 2nd Edition



• Are security roles and responsibilities clearly defined and communicated?
• Is there a CISO or other officer with sufficient authority and resources to

accomplish security objectives?
• Has the organisation ever had its network security checked by a 

third party?
• Has a business impact assessment been performed?
• When was the last risk assessment made on the criticality and sensitivity of

information security assets? When is the next risk assessment scheduled?
• Does the risk assessment consider whether the entity can continue to

operate if critical information is unavailable, compromised or lost? Does it
cover the consequences of a security incident in terms of lost revenues, lost
customers and investor confidence? Does it determine what the
consequences would be if the infrastructure became inoperable?

• Does the CEO request an information security evaluation, and are the
results reviewed with staff and reported to the board of directors?

• Is there an effective and tested process to deal with information security
incidents/emergencies?

• Is there a business continuity/disaster recovery plan in place? Has it been
tested under live circumstances? Is it tested regularly?

• Does the risk assessment consider what information assets are subject to
laws and regulations? Does it result in adequate procedures to assure
compliance with these laws and regulations?

• Is information security risk assessment a regular agenda item at IT and
business management meetings and does management follow through and
support improvement initiatives?

• Does the organisation have a security strategy? If so, is it closely aligned
with the overall business strategy?

• Is there an ongoing process to ensure alignment of information security
with business objectives?

• Are there appropriate training and awareness programmes to ensure that
personnel are aware of their security responsibilities and the expectations of
management?

• Is there an information asset classification process in place to ensure that
critical assets are adequately protected?

IT Governance Institute 35



9. How Does My Organisation Compare on Information 
Security Governance?

Boards of directors and executive management can use an information
security governance maturity model to establish rankings for maturity within
an organisation. When IT risk is referenced, it should be considered within
the context of information security. This model21 can be progressively applied
as a method for:
• Self-assessment against the scales, deciding where the organisation is, as

shown in figure 3
• Using the results of the self-assessment to set targets for future

development, based on where the organisation wants to be on the scale,
which is not necessarily at the top level

• Planning projects to reach the targets, based on an analysis of the gaps
between those targets and the present status

• Prioritising project work based on project classification and an analysis of
its beneficial impact against its cost

Maturity Level Description
0 Non-existent
• Risk assessment for processes and business decisions does not occur. The

organisation does not consider the business impacts associated with
security vulnerabilities and development project uncertainties. Risk
management has not been identified as relevant to acquiring IT solutions
and delivering IT services.

36 Information Security Governance
Guidance for Boards of Directors and Executive Management, 2nd Edition

Figure 3—Maturity Model Dashboard

21 Adapted from IT Governance Institute, COBIT 4.0, USA, 2005



• The organisation does not recognise the need for information security.
Responsibilities and accountabilities are not assigned for ensuring security.
Measures supporting the management of information security are not
implemented. There is no information security reporting and no response
process to information security breaches. There is a complete lack of a
recognisable system security administration process.

• There is no understanding of the risks, vulnerabilities and threats to IT
operations or the impact of loss of IT services to the business. Service
continuity is not considered as needing management attention.

1 Initial/Ad Hoc
• The organisation considers IT risks in an ad hoc manner, without following

defined processes or policies. Informal assessments of project risk take
place as determined by each project.

• The organisation recognises the need for information security, but security
awareness depends on the individual. Information security is addressed on
a reactive basis and is not measured. Information security breaches invoke
finger-pointing responses if detected, because responsibilities are unclear.
Responses to information security breaches are unpredictable.

• Responsibilities for continuous service are informal, with limited authority.
Management is becoming aware of the risks related to and the need for
continuous service.

2 Repeatable but Intuitive
• There is an emerging understanding that IT risks are important and need to

be considered. An approach to risk assessment exists, but the process is still
immature and developing.

• Responsibilities and accountabilities for information security are assigned
to an information security co-coordinator with no management authority.
Security awareness is fragmented and limited. Information security
information is generated, but not analysed. Security tends to respond
reactively to information security incidents and by adopting third-party
offerings, without addressing the specific needs of the organisation.
Security policies are being developed, but inadequate skills and tools are
still being used. Information security reporting is incomplete, misleading or
not pertinent.

• Responsibility for continuous service is assigned. The approaches to
continuous service are fragmented. Reporting on system availability is
incomplete and does not take business impact into account.

IT Governance Institute 37



3 Defined Process
• An organisationwide risk management policy defines when and how to

conduct risk assessments. Risk assessment follows a defined process that is
documented and available to all staff through training.

• Security awareness exists and is promoted by management. Security
awareness briefings have been standardised and formalised. Information
security procedures are defined and fit into a structure for security policies
and procedures. Responsibilities for information security are assigned, but
are not consistently enforced. An information security plan exists, driving
risk analysis and security solutions. Information security reporting is 
IT-focused, rather than business-focused. Ad hoc intrusion testing is
performed.

• Management communicates consistently the need for continuous service.
High-availability components and system redundancy are being applied
piecemeal. An inventory of critical systems and components is rigorously
maintained.

4 Managed and Measurable
• The assessment of risk is a standard procedure and exceptions to following

the procedure would be noticed by IT management. It is likely that IT risk
management is a defined management function with senior-level
responsibility. Senior management and IT management have determined
the levels of risk that the organisation will tolerate and have standard
measures for risk/return ratios.

• Responsibilities for information security are clearly assigned, managed and
enforced. Information security risk and impact analysis is consistently
performed. Security policies and practices are completed, with specific
security baselines. Security awareness briefings are mandatory. User
identification, authentication and authorisation are standardised. Security
certification of staff is established. Intrusion testing is a standard and
formalised process, leading to improvements. Cost-benefit analysis,
supporting the implementation of security measures, is increasingly being
utilised. Information security processes are co-ordinated with the overall
organisation security function. Information security reporting is linked to
business objectives.

• Responsibilities and standards for continuous service are enforced. System
redundancy practices, including use of high-availability components, are
consistently deployed.

38 Information Security Governance
Guidance for Boards of Directors and Executive Management, 2nd Edition



5 Optimised
• Risk management has developed to the stage that a structured,

organisationwide process is enforced, followed regularly and managed well.
• Information security is a joint responsibility of business and IT

management and is integrated with enterprise security business objectives.
Information security requirements are clearly defined, optimised and
included in a verified security plan. Security functions are integrated with
applications at the design stage and end users are increasingly accountable
for managing security. Information security reporting provides early
warning of changing and emerging risk, using automated active monitoring
approaches for critical systems. Incidents are promptly addressed, with
formalised incident response procedures supported by automated tools.
Periodic security assessments evaluate the effectiveness of implementation
of the security plan. Information on new threats and vulnerabilities is
systematically collected and analysed, and adequate mitigating controls are
promptly communicated and implemented. Intrusion testing, root cause
analysis of security incidents and proactive identification of risk are the
basis for continuous improvements. Security processes and technologies are
integrated organisationwide.

• Continuous service plans and business continuity plans are integrated,
aligned and routinely maintained. Buy-in for continuous service needs is
secured from vendors and major suppliers.

IT Governance Institute 39



Appendix—Regulatory and Standards Bodies’ Guidance on
Information Security Governance

There are a number of international standards and regulatory bodies that deal
with security of information and the systems that handle and process it. This
is not meant to be an exhaustive list but rather to give a flavour of how some
of the major ones address the issue of information security. The approach,
segmentation and focus vary widely but the security standards and objectives
are consistent.

COBIT® 4.0 (2005)
Developed and promoted by the IT Governance Institute (ITGI), Control
Objectives for Information and related Technology (COBIT®) starts from the
premise that IT needs to deliver the information that the enterprise needs to
achieve its objectives. In addition to promoting process focus and process
ownership, COBIT looks at fiduciary, quality and security needs of
enterprises and provides seven information criteria that can be used to
generically define what the business requires from IT: effectiveness,
efficiency, availability, integrity, confidentiality, reliability and compliance.

COBIT further divides IT into 34 processes belonging to four domains (Plan
and Organise [PO], Acquire and Implement [AI], Deliver and Support [DS],
and Monitor and Evaluate [ME]). The COBIT framework addresses
information security issues of concern in more than 20 processes. However,
the four processes that are most directly related to information security are:
• PO6—Communicate management aims 

and directions.
• PO9—Assess and manage IT risks.
• DS4—Ensure continuous service.
• DS5—Ensure systems security.

For each process, a high-level control objective is defined:
• Identifying which information criteria are most important in that IT process
• Listing which resources will usually be leveraged
• Providing considerations on what is important for controlling that IT

process

COBIT further provides more than 200 detailed control objectives for
management and IT practitioners who are looking for best practices in
control implementation, as well as management guidelines and maturity
models building on these objectives.

40 Information Security Governance
Guidance for Boards of Directors and Executive Management, 2nd Edition



COBIT includes a management and governance layer, providing 
management with:
• Performance measurement elements (outcome measures and performance

drivers for all IT processes)
• A list of key activities that provides succinct, non-technical best practices

for each IT process
• A maturity model to assist in benchmarking and decision making for

control over IT

COBIT Security Baseline (2004) 
Also published by ITGI, it addresses security in addition to the risks of the
use of IT. Using the COBIT framework, the guidance focuses on the specific
risks of IT security in a way that is easy to follow and implement for all
users—home, small to medium enterprises, and executives and board
members of larger organisations. It provides the following elements:
• Useful reading:

– An introduction to information security—what it means and what 
it covers

– An explanation of why security is important, with examples of the most
common things that can go wrong 

– Some thought-provoking questions to help determine the risk
• The COBIT-based security baseline, providing key controls and mapping to

ISO 17799
• Six information security survival kits, providing essential awareness

messages for specific audiences 
• An appendix containing a summary of technical security risks

Guidelines for the Security of Information Systems (2002)
The Organisation for Economic Co-operations and Development’s (OECD’s)
Guidelines for the Security of Information Systems is designed to assist
countries and enterprises to construct a framework for security of
information systems. The guidelines are intended to:
• Raise awareness of risks to and safeguards for information systems
• Offer a general framework to aid in the development and implementation

of effective measures, practices and procedures for the security of
information systems and encourage co-operation between the public and
private sectors regarding same

• Promote confidence in information systems, their implementation and use
• Facilitate national and international development, use and security of

information systems

The framework covers laws, codes of conduct, technical measures,
management and user practices, and public education/awareness activities.
Ultimately, the intention is that the guidelines will serve as a benchmark
against which governments, the public and private sectors, and society can
measure progress.

IT Governance Institute 41



Managing Security of Information (1998) 
In 1998, International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) defined the
objective of information security as, ‘the protection of the interests of those
relying on information, and the information systems and communications
that deliver the information, from harm resulting from failures of availability,
confidentiality and integrity’. Any organisation may consider the security
objective met when those three criteria are satisfied, that is, when
information systems are available and usable when required (availability),
data and information are disclosed only to those who have a right to know
them (confidentiality), and data and information are protected against
unauthorised modification (integrity).

Availability, confidentiality and integrity may take on differing priorities or
significance depending on the data within the information system and the
business context in which they are used.

Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information
Systems, NIST 800-53A (Initial Public Draft 2005)
This document was developed by the US National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) to further its statutory responsibilities under the US
Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, P.L. 107-
347.  NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including
minimum requirements, for providing adequate information security for all
agency operations and assets, but the standards and guidelines do not apply
to national security systems. This guideline was prepared for use by US
federal agencies, but it may be appropriate for non-governmental agencies on
a voluntary basis. Some of its benefits are:
• It facilitates a consistent, comparable and repeatable approach for selecting

and specifying security controls.
• It provides a recommendation for minimum controls for information systems.
• It promotes dynamic catalogue of security controls for information systems.
• It creates a foundation for the development of techniques and procedures

for verifying security control effectiveness.

The publication is intended to provide guidance to US federal agencies 
until the publication of Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 200,
Minimum Security Controls for Federal Information Systems (published
December 2005).

Code of Practice for Information Security Management,
ISO 17799 (2005) 
International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) 17799, Code of Practice
for Information Security Management, is intended to serve as a single
reference point for identifying the range of controls needed for most
situations where information systems are used in industry and commerce. 

42 Information Security Governance
Guidance for Boards of Directors and Executive Management, 2nd Edition



It is suitable for use by any size organisation. It treats information as an asset
that, like other important business assets, has value to the organisation and
consequently needs to be suitably protected.
Information security is characterised within ISO 17799 as the preservation of:
• Confidentiality—Ensuring that information is accessible only to those

authorised to have access to it
• Integrity—Safeguarding the accuracy and completeness of information and

processing methods
• Availability—Ensuring that authorised users have access to information and

associated assets when required

The standard is based on security risk assessment. This provides the basis 
for cost justification and improved productivity of security staff, amongst 
other outcomes.

Information security protects information from a wide range of threats
thereby ensuring business continuity, minimising business damage,
maximising return on investments and capitalising on business opportunities.
Security is achieved by implementing a suitable set of controls, which
consist of policies, practices, procedures, organisational structures and/or
software functions. ISO has issued other security standards including ISO
15048, Evaluation Criteria for IT Security.

Trust Services (SysTrust) Principles and Criteria 
for Systems Reliability (2003) 
The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA)/Canadian
Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA) published Trust Services
(SysTrust), an assurance service designed to increase the comfort of
management, customers and business partners. The SysTrust service entails
the certified public accountant providing an assurance service in which
he/she evaluates and tests whether a system is reliable when measured
against four essential principles: availability, security, integrity and
maintainability.
• Availability—The system is available for operation and use at times set

forth in service level statements or agreements.
• Security—The system is protected against unauthorised physical and

logical access.
• Integrity—System processing is complete, accurate, timely and authorised.
• Maintainability—When necessary, the system can be updated in a way that

does not interfere or conflict with its availability, security and integrity.

SysTrust defines a reliable system as one that is capable of operating without
material error, fault or failure during a specified period in a specified
environment. The boundaries of the system are defined by the system owner
and must include the following key components: infrastructure, software,
people, procedures and data.

IT Governance Institute 43



SysTrust is scalable, so enterprises have the flexibility to choose any or 
all of the SysTrust principles for verification. An opinion rendered on all
criteria constitutes an opinion on the overall reliability of the system. The
accountant can also render an opinion on individual criteria, such as
availability or security.

Standard of Good Practice for Information Security (2005)
The Information Security Forum’s (ISF’s) Standard of Good Practice for
Information Security is based on research and practical experience of
members. ‘The standard addresses information security from a business
perspective, providing a practical basis for assessing an organisation’s
information security arrangements. It focuses on the arrangements that
should be made by leading organisations to keep the business risks
associated with critical information systems under control’.22 Each area is
broken down into a number of detailed sections, totaling 135 appropriate
controls.

ISF states that, in general, implementing the standard helps organisations to:
• Move toward international best practice and maintain business integrity
• Manage the breadth and depth of information risk
• Build confidence in third parties that information security is being

addressed in a professional manner
• Reduce the likelihood of disruption from major incidents
• Fight the growing threats of cybercrime
• Comply with legal and regulatory requirements

The standard breaks security into five component areas:
• Security management
• Critical business applications
• Computer installations
• Networks
• Systems development

Information Security Governance: Call to Action (2004)
In December 2003, the US Department of Homeland Security co-hosted a
National Cyber Security Summit in Santa Clara, California, USA. The
immediate outcome was the formation of five task forces by the private
sector, including the Corporate Governance Task Force. In its report, the task
force called upon all organisations to make information security governance
a corporate board-level priority. The key focus was to begin the process, with
the subsequent goal of systematic improvement of performance over time.

44 Information Security Governance
Guidance for Boards of Directors and Executive Management, 2nd Edition

22 Information Security Forum, Standard of Good Practice for Information Security, version 4,
UK, 2003 



The report also includes a number of recommendations for government and
industry action, including:
• Organisations should adopt the information security governance framework

described in the report to embed cybersecurity into their corporate
governance process. 

• Organisations should signal their commitment to information security
governance by stating on their web sites that they intend to use the tools
developed by the task force to assess their performance and report the
results to their board of directors. 

• The US Department of Homeland Security should endorse the information
security governance framework and its core set of principles, and
encourage the private sector to make cybersecurity part of its corporate
governance efforts. 

• The Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO) should revise Internal Controls—An Integrated Framework so it
explicitly addresses information security governance.
